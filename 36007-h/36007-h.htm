AND THE CHRISTMAS SHIP</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE UNITED SERVICE CLUB AT HOME</div>


<div class='cap'>"IT'S up to Roger Morton to admit that there's
real, true romance in the world after all," decided
Margaret Hancock as she sat on the Mortons'
porch one afternoon a few days after school had
opened in the September following the summer
when the Mortons and Hancocks had met for the
first time at Chautauqua. James and Margaret had
trolleyed over to see Roger and Helen from Glen
Point, about three quarters of an hour's ride from
Rosemont where the Mortons lived.</div>

<p>"Roger's ready to admit it," confessed that young
man. "When you have an aunt drop right down
on your door mat, so to speak, after your family has
been hunting her for twenty years, and when you find
that you've been knowing her daughter, your own
cousin, pretty well for two months it does make the
regular go-to-school life that you and I used to lead
look quite prosy."</p>

<p>"How did she happen to lose touch so completely
with her family?"</p>

<p>"I told you how Grandfather Morton, her father,
opposed her marrying Uncle Leonard Smith because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
he was a musician. Well, she did marry him, and
when they got into straits she was too proud to tell
her father about it."</p>

<p>"I suppose Grandfather would have said, 'I told
you so,'" suggested Helen.</p>

<p>"And I believe it takes more courage than it's
worth to face a person who's given to saying that,"
concluded James.</p>

<p>"Aunt Louise evidently thought it wasn't worth
while or else she didn't have the courage and so she
drifted away. Her mother was dead and she had
no sisters and Father and Uncle Richard probably
didn't write very often."</p>

<p>"She thought nobody at home loved her, I suppose,"
said Helen. "Father and Uncle Richard
did love her tremendously, but they were just young
fellows at the time and they didn't realize what their
not writing meant to her."</p>

<p>"Once in a while they heard of Uncle Leonard
through the music papers," went on Roger, "but after
his health failed, Aunt Louise told us the other day,
he couldn't make concert appearances and of course
a man merely playing in an orchestra isn't big enough
to command public attention."</p>

<p>"By the time that Grandfather Morton died about
twelve years ago she was completely lost to the family,"
Helen continued, "and she says she didn't know
of his death until five years after, when she came
accidentally upon some mention of it in a local paper
that she picked up somewhere."</p>

<p>"That was after Uncle Leonard's death, but it
seemed to her that she could not make herself known
to her people without being disloyal to his memory,"
Roger carried on the story.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"She probably thought that your father and uncle
were just as much opposed to him as her father had
been," guessed Margaret.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, they have been hunting
hard for her through every clue that promised any
result ever since Grandfather died because they
wanted to give her her share of his property."</p>

<p>"He didn't cut her off with a shilling, then?"</p>

<p>"Grandfather seems to have had a change of heart,
for he left her more than he did his sons. He said
she needed it more."</p>

<p>"And it has been accumulating all this time."</p>

<p>"Seven years. That means a very pleasant increase
for her and Dorothy."</p>

<p>"She must think rather sadly of the days when
they suffered real privation for the lack of it," said
Helen.</p>

<p>"Anyway, here they are now, with money in their
pockets and an affectionate family all ready made for
them and they are going to live here in Rosemont
near us, and Dorothy is going to school with the
Ethels, and I'm willing to admit that it comes nearer
to being a romance than anything I ever heard of in
real life," and Roger nodded his head gleefully.</p>

<p>"I'm glad she's going to live here so we can see
her once in a while," said Margaret. "Mother and
Sister and I all loved her at Chautauqua, she was so
patient and gentle with the people she taught. And
of course we all think Dorothy is a darling."</p>

<p>"The Ethels are crazy over her. They treat her
as if she were some new belonging and they can
hardly bear to have her out of their sight."</p>

<p>"It was Grandfather Emerson who said all summer
that she looked like the Ethels," remarked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Roger. "Her hair is fuzzy and her nose is puggy,
but I didn't see much other likeness."</p>

<p>"When she grows as fat as the Ethels I think she'll
look astonishingly like them. She's thin and pale,
now, poor little dud."</p>

<p>"I wish she could grow as plump as Della Watkins."</p>

<p>"I saw Tom Watkins yesterday," said James.</p>

<p>"What was a haughty New Yorker doing on the
Jersey side of the Hudson?"</p>

<p>"It seems he boards Cupid and his family at the
Rosemont Kennels&mdash;you know they're half way between
here and Glen Point. He was going to call
on them."</p>

<p>"Dear Cupid!" laughed Margaret, recalling the
bulldog's alarming face which ill agreed with his
mild name and general behavior. "Let's go over
to the Kennels and see him some day."</p>

<p>"His wife is named Psyche," went on James, "and
they have two pups named Amor and Amorette."</p>

<p>"I should think Cupid's puppy would be the funniest
little animal on earth," roared Roger. "Never,
never shall I forget the day old Cupe ran away with
his market wagon," and he kicked his legs with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Did Tom say anything about coming to see us?"
asked Margaret.</p>

<p>"He said he and Della were coming over on Saturday
afternoon and he inquired how far it was from
Glen Point to Rosemont and whether they could
make two calls in one afternoon."</p>

<p>"Not if he stays at either place as long as we'd
like to have him," said Roger.</p>

<p>"Why don't we have a meeting of the United<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Service Club on Saturday afternoon?" suggested
Helen, "and then the Watkinses can come here and
you two can come and we can all see each other and
at the same time decide on what we are going to do
this winter."</p>

<p>"Great head!" approved Roger. "Can you people
be here?"</p>

<p>"We can," assented Margaret.</p>

<p>"And we will." James completed the sentence
for her.</p>

<p>"Here are the children. They've been asking
when we were to have the first meeting, so I know
they'll be glad to give Saturday afternoon to it."</p>

<p>"The children" of Helen's patronizing expression
came rushing into the yard at the moment. Ethel
Brown Morton, tall and rosy, her cheeks flushed
with running, led the way; her cousin, Ethel Blue
Morton, not quite so tall or quite so rosy, made a
fair second, and their newly-found cousin, Dorothy
Smith, brought up the rear, panting a trifle harder
than the rest, but already looking plumper and sturdier
than she had during the summer at Chautauqua.</p>

<p>They greeted Margaret and James gladly, and
sat down on the steps of the porch to engage in the
conversation.</p>

<p>"Hullo," a voice came through the screen door.
"I'm coming out."</p>

<p>"That must be my friend Dicky," declared James.
"Come on, old man," and he arranged his knees in
position to serve as a seat for the six-year-old who
calmly sat himself down upon them.</p>

<p>"How are you?" questioned James gravely. "All
right?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Firtht rate," replied Dicky briefly. "Have a
thuck?" and he offered James the moist end of an
all-day-sucker, withdrawing it from his own mouth
for the purpose.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I'm not eating candy to-day, sir,"
responded James seriously. "Much obliged to you,
all the same."</p>

<p>Dicky nodded his recognition of James's thanks
and resumed his occupation.</p>

<p>"It keeps us still though we're not pretty to look
at as we do it," commented Ethel Brown.</p>

<p>"You're talking about me," asserted Dicky suddenly,
once more removing his sucker from his increasingly
sticky lips and fixing an accusing eye upon
his sister.</p>

<p>"She was, Dicky, that's true," interposed Helen
quickly, "but she loves you just as much as if she
were talking about Roger."</p>

<p>Dicky regarded this as a compliment and subsided
against James's chest.</p>

<p>"We're going to try and get the Watkinses to
come out next Saturday afternoon and the Hancocks
will come over and we'll have a meeting of the
United Service," explained Roger to the new arrivals.</p>

<p>"Good enough!" approved Ethel Brown.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Madam President?"
inquired Ethel Blue, who felt a lively interest in any
future plans because the Club was her idea.</p>

<p>"We'll all think of things between now and Saturday,
and suggest them then."</p>

<p>"Tell the Watkinses when you write to them,
Helen."</p>

<p>"I'm just boiling over with ideas for the Club<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to put into execution some time or other," announced
Roger.</p>

<p>"Big ones or little?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Some of them are pretty big, but I have a feeling
in my bones that they'll go through."</p>

<p>"Good for old Roger's bones!" commended
James. "May we venture to ask what some of them
are?"</p>

<p>"'Nothing venture, nothing have,'" quoted
Roger. "I'm merely saying now, however, that the
biggest scheme is one that I told Grandfather Emerson
about the other day and he said he'd help by
giving us the house for it."</p>

<p>"What should we do that would need a house?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;house?"</p>

<p>Roger grinned delightedly at the commotion he
had caused.</p>

<p>"This plan I have is so big that we'll have to get
the grown-ups to help us, but we'll do most of the
carrying out ourselves in spite of that."</p>

<p>"I should think we would have to have their help
if your plan calls for a house."</p>

<p>"You needn't be sarcastic, young woman. This is
a perfectly good scheme&mdash;Grandfather said so. He
said it was so good that he was willing to back it
and to help us by supplying the house we should
need."</p>

<p>"Poor old Roger&mdash;gone clean crazy," sighed
James.</p>

<p>"I almost think so," agreed Helen.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you something, you scoffers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell on; that's what we're waiting for."</p>

<p>"Well, on the whole, I guess I won't tell you a
thing about it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you aren't the very meanest boy I ever knew
in my life," decided Margaret whole-heartedly.
"To work our curiosity all up this way and then not
to tell us a thing."</p>

<p>"I didn't get the encouragement that the plan deserved."</p>

<p>"Like all great inventors," commented James.</p>

<p>"They all come out on top at the end, I notice,"
retorted Roger. "You just watch me about next
April when the buds begin to swell."</p>

<p>"Heads begin to swell at any time of year, apparently."</p>

<p>"Especially bad cases begin in the autumn&mdash;about
September."</p>

<p>"Oh, you wait, just wait," threatened Roger.
"When you haven't an idea what to do to make the
Club really useful for another minute then you'll recall
that I promised you a really big plan. <i>Then</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you aren't going to tell us now I think we'd
better talk about something that has some connection
with what we're going to do in September instead
of this April Fool thing of yours," said Helen
somewhat sharply.</p>

<p>"Let's not talk about it until Saturday," begged
Ethel Blue. "Then we can all put our minds on it."</p>

<p>"I rise to remark, Madam President," continued
James, "that I believe this Club has a great future
before it if it does not get involved in wildcat
schemes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now listen to that!" exclaimed Roger. "There
speaks the canny Scot that was James's great-grandfather.
Cautious old Hancock! Now you really
have got me riled. I vow to you, fellow-clubmen
and -women that I won't be the first to propose this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
scheme again. You'll have to come to me. And
I'll prophesy that you will come to me about the
first of next April."</p>

<p>"Why April?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to do with April Fool, I assure you.
But about that time we shall have worked off all the
ideas that we've cooked up to carry us through the
winter and we'll be glad to undertake a service that
is a service&mdash;the real thing."</p>

<p>"We're going to do the real thing all the time."
Ethel Blue defended her idea. "But I dare say
we'll want to do your thing, too."</p>

<p>"Grandfather's recommendation doesn't seem to
count with you young know-it-alls."</p>

<p>"Grandfather's recommendation is the only reason
why our remarks weren't more severe," retorted
Ethel Brown.</p>

<p>"Each of us must bring in a list next Saturday,"
said Helen, as they all walked to the corner to see
that the Hancocks took the car safely.</p>

<p>"And I believe that every one will be a perfectly
good plan," said Roger magnanimously.</p>

<p>"There won't be one that will require a house to
hold it anyway," retorted Margaret.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>DOROTHY'S COTTAGE</div>


<div class='cap'>ROSEMONT and Glen Point were two New
Jersey towns near enough to New York to
permit business men to commute every day and far
enough away from the big city to furnish plenty of
air and space for the growing generation. It was
the latter qualification that endeared them to the
Morton and Hancock families, for there were no
commuters in their households. Lieutenant Morton,
father of Roger and Helen and Ethel Brown
and Dicky, was on his ship in the harbor of Vera
Cruz. Captain Morton, his brother, father of
Ethel Blue, had returned to Gen. Funston's army
after finding their sister, Mrs. Smith, at Chautauqua
and convoying her with all the Mortons
and Mrs. Morton's father and mother, Mr. and
Mrs. Emerson, back to Rosemont. His short furlough
did not allow him to remain long enough to
see his sister established in a house of her own, but
it was understood that she was to hire a furnished
house as near as possible to the Mortons' and live in
it until she made up her mind where she wanted to
build.</div>

<p>"Dorothy and I have wandered about the United
States so long," she said plaintively, "that we are
thankful to settle down in a town and a house that
we can call our own, and we shall be even happier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
when we have a bungalow actually belonging to us."</p>

<p>At present they were still staying with the Mortons,
but the Morton family was so large that two
visitors crowded them uncomfortably and Mrs.
Smith felt that she must not trespass upon her sister-in-law's
hospitality longer than was absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>"I think the white cottage just around the corner
will be the one that we will take," she said to Dorothy.
"Come with me there again this afternoon
for one more look at it, and then we'll make up our
minds."</p>

<p>So they went to the white cottage and carefully
studied its merits.</p>

<p>"The principal good thing about it is that it is
near Aunt Marion's," declared Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I think so, too. And it is near school and church
and the butcher's and baker's and candlestick-maker's.
We shan't have very far to walk for anything."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother, it doesn't seem possible that this
can be <i>us</i> really living and not just perching around,
and having enough money and enough to eat and
nothing to worry about."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith threw her arm about Dorothy's shoulder.</p>

<p>"The thing for you to do to show your gratitude
is to grow well and strong just as fast as you can.
I want to see you as rosy as the Ethels."</p>

<p>"They run me around so much that I think they'll
do it for me before very long."</p>

<p>"They have a start, though, so you'll have to do
all the vigorous things that they do and others
too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean exercises at home?"</p>

<p>"Every morning when you get up you should do
what a cat does when he wakes from a nap."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;he stretches himself way out to the tips
of his claws."</p>

<p>"And shakes himself all over. What do you suppose
he's doing it for?"</p>

<p>"To stretch his muscles, I should think."</p>

<p>"And to loosen his skin and make himself generally
flexible. Have you ever seen a sick cat? His
coat looks dull and dry and woolly instead of silky,
and when you feel of him his skin doesn't slip over
his bones easily. It wouldn't be very complimentary
to ourselves to say that you and I are sick cats just
now, but it wouldn't be far from the truth."</p>

<p>"I don't much like the sound of it," laughed Dorothy.
"What can we invalid pussies do to get
well?"</p>

<p>"A few simple exercises we ought to take every
morning when we first get out of bed. We ought
to stand first on one foot and then on the other, and
swing vigorously the foot that is off the floor."</p>

<p>"That's easy."</p>

<p>"Then if we stretch our arms upward as high as
we can, first one and then the other and then both,
and then put our hands on the ribs of each side and
stretch and lift them we shall have limbered up the
lower and the upper parts of ourselves pretty thoroughly."</p>

<p>"I learned a good exercise for the waist muscles
at the Girls' Club last summer. You sit down and
roll the body at the waist line in all directions. You
can do it standing, too; that brings in some different
muscles."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll do that. These few exercises will wake
up every part of the body."</p>

<p>"We ought to do them with the windows open."</p>

<p>"When you first wake up after having the windows
wide open all night you don't realize the cold in
your room. It isn't until you have been to a warmer
room that you notice the cold in your bedroom. So
the best time to take these exercises is just the minute
you hop out of bed. Stand in front of the open
window and take deep breaths of air way down into
the very lower tips of your lungs so that every tiny
cell will be puffed out with good, fresh oxygen."</p>

<p>"It will take a lot of time to do all those exercises."</p>

<p>"Five minutes every morning will be enough if we
do them vigorously. And you mustn't forget that
your aim is to catch up with the Ethels."</p>

<p>"And then to beat them. I'll do it."</p>

<p>They went slowly through the cottage and planned
the purpose to which they would put each room. It
was simply furnished, but all the necessities were
there.</p>

<p>"It's more fun this way than if there were a lot of
furniture," said Dorothy, "because we can get what
is lacking to suit ourselves."</p>

<p>"All the time that we are here we can be making
plans for building our own little house."</p>

<p>"I can hardly wait to have it."</p>

<p>They hugged each other in their happiness and the
tears were not far from the eyelids of both of them,
for Mrs. Smith had not known anything but the actual
necessities of living for many years and Dorothy
had never known many comforts that had been every
day matters and not luxuries to her mother's youth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>So Mrs. Smith hired the white cottage and she and
Dorothy moved in at once. A cousin of Mary,
Mrs. Morton's old servant, who had been Dicky's
nurse, came to work for them, and by the time of
the first meeting of the United Service Club Dorothy
felt so settled in her new home that she wanted to
have the meeting in the living-room or the big attic
just to see how it felt to be entertaining people in
her own house.</p>

<p>"I think I wouldn't suggest it this time," Mrs.
Smith warned her. "Helen is the president, you
see, and it seems more suitable for the first meeting
to be held at her house. Ask if you mayn't have
the next one here. How often are you going to
meet?"</p>

<p>"I hope it will be once a week, and so does Ethel
Blue. She thinks there's plenty of occupation to
keep a service club busy all the time."</p>

<p>At noon the sun disappeared and the Rosemont
members of the U. S. C. began to have doubts as to
whether the Hancocks and Watkinses would appear.</p>

<p>"Even if it rains hard I think James and Margaret
will come," said Helen. "The trolley brings
them almost from their door to ours; but I don't feel
so sure about the Watkinses."</p>

<p>"It doesn't take but ten minutes longer for them
to come out from New York than for the Hancocks
to come over from Glen Point."</p>

<p>"But they have to cross the ferry and take the
train and it seems more of an undertaking than just
to hop into a street car."</p>

<p>"It's getting so dark and gloomy&mdash;what do you
say if you Ethels make some candy to enliven the
afternoon?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is there time before they come?"</p>

<p>"Just about. Try Vinegar Candy this time. If
you leave half of it unstirred and stir the other half
it will be as good as two kinds, you know."</p>

<p>So the Ethels went off into a pantry back of the
kitchen, where Mrs. Morton had had a small gas
stove installed so that the children might cook to
their hearts' content without interfering with the occupants
of the kitchen.</p>

<p>"There's nothing that upsets people who are trying
to make a house run smoothly and to do its work
promptly and well as to have children come into the
kitchen and use the stove when it is needed for other
purposes, and get in the way and leave their cooking
apparatus around and their pots and pans uncleaned,"
declared Mrs. Morton.</p>

<p>So the Ethels and Helen, and Roger, too, for he
was a capital cook and was in great demand whenever
the boys went on camping trips, all contributed
from their allowances to buy a simple equipment for
this tiny kitchen which they called their own. Mrs.
Morton paid for the stove, but the saucepans and
baking tins, the flour and sugar and eggs, the flavoring
extracts and the seasonings were all supplied
by the children, and it was understood that when a
cooking fit seized them they must think out beforehand
what they were going to want and provide
themselves with it and not call on the cook or Mary
to help them out of an emergency caused by their
own thoughtlessness. Mrs. Morton was sure that
her reputation as a sensible mother who did not let
the children over-run the kitchen at times when they
were decidedly in the way was one of the chief reasons
why her servants stayed with her so long.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>So now Ethel Brown said to Ethel Blue, "Have
we got all the materials we need for Vinegar
Candy?" and Ethel Blue seized the cook book and
read the receipt.</p>

<p>"Mix together three cupfuls of sugar, half a cupful
of vinegar, half a cupful of water. When it
comes to a boil stir in one teaspoonful of soda."</p>

<p>"We've got sugar and soda and water," announced
Ethel Brown after investigating the shelves
of the tiny storeroom, "but there isn't any vinegar.
I do hate to go out in this rain," for the dark sky
was making good its threat.</p>

<p>"I'll get it for you. Give me your jug," said
Roger, swinging into his raincoat. "I'll be back in
half a jiff," and he dashed off into the downpour,
shaking his head like a Newfoundland dog, and
spattering the drops as he ran.</p>

<p>He was back before the Ethels had their pans
buttered and the water and sugar measured, so
briskly had he galloped. It was only a few minutes
more before the candy stiffened when a little was
dropped into a cup of cold water.</p>

<p>"Now we'll pour half of it into one of the pans,"
directed Ethel Brown, "and then we'll get Roger to
beat the other half so it will be creamy."</p>

<p>Roger was entirely willing to lend his muscles to
so good a cause and soon had the mass grained and
white.</p>

<p>"Good work; one boiling for two batches!" he
declared. "That pleases my notions of scientific
management."</p>

<p>When the door-bell rang for the first arrivals the
whole thing was almost cold, and Mary, who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
always willing to help in an emergency, hastened the
chilling process by popping the tins into the ice box.</p>

<p>"They're not warm enough any longer to melt the
ice," she decided, "so I'll just hurry 'em up a bit."</p>

<p>After all the discussion about the city dwellers'
dislike of going into the suburbs it was the Watkinses
who came first.</p>

<p>"We're ahead of the hour," apologized Della.
"We couldn't time ourselves exactly for so long a
distance."</p>

<p>"The Hancocks will come just on the dot, I've no
doubt," laughed Tom. "Old James is just that accurate
person!"</p>

<p>As the clock's hand was on the appointed minute a
whir at the bell announced Margaret and James, both
dripping from their run from the corner.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Morton's compliments and she thought they
had better drink this so they won't get cold."</p>

<p>"Our compliments and thanks to Mrs. Morton,"
returned Tom, his hand dramatically placed over a
portion of his person which is said to be the gateway
to a boy's heart.</p>

<p>When the cups had been emptied and the wafers
consumed and the Ethels had taken away the tray
with the remains of the feast and had brought back
the two kinds of candy, carefully cut into squares
and heaped in two of the pretty Japanese bowls
which made a part of their private kitchen equipment,
they all settled down in big chairs and on couches except
Roger, who sat near the fire to stir it, and
Helen, who established herself at one end of the
table where she could see them all conveniently.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CHRISTMAS SHIP</div>


<div class='cap'>"THE meeting will come to order," commanded
Helen, her face bubbling with the
conflict between her dignity and her desire to laugh
at her dignity.</div>

<p>"We haven't any secretary, so there can't be any
minutes of the last meeting."</p>

<p>Helen glanced sidewise at James, for she was talking
about something she never had had occasion to
mention in all her life before and she wondered if
he were being properly impressed with the ease with
which she spoke of the non-existent minutes.</p>

<p>James responded to her look with an expression
of surprise so comical that Helen almost burst into
laughter most unsuitable for the presiding officer of
so distinguished a gathering.</p>

<p>"Oughtn't we to have a secretary?" asked Tom.
"If we're going to have a really shipshape club this
winter it seems to me we ought to have some record
of what we do."</p>

<p>"And there may be letters to write," urged Roger,
"and who'd do them?"</p>

<p>"Not old Roger, I'll bet!" cried James in humorous
scorn.</p>

<p>"I don't notice that anybody is addressing the
chair," remarked Helen sternly, and James flushed,
for he had been the president's instructor in parliamentary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
law at the meeting when the Club was organized,
and he did not relish being caught in a
mistake.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Madam President," he apologized.</p>

<p>"I don't see any especial need for a secretary, Miss
President," said Margaret, "but can't we tell better
when we're a little farther along and know what
we're going to do?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," agreed Helen. "There isn't any
treasurer's report for the same reason that there
isn't any secretary's," she continued.</p>

<p>"Just to cut off another discussion I'd like to repeat
my remark," said Margaret.</p>

<p>"If we become multi-millionaires later on we can
appoint a treasurer then," said Della, her round
face unusually grave.</p>

<p>"Instead of a secretary's report it seems to me it
would be interesting to remember what the Club
did last summer to live up to its name," suggested
Tom. "You know Della and I weren't elected until
after you'd been going some time, and I'm not
sure that I know everything that happened."</p>

<p>The Mortons and Dorothy and the Hancocks
looked around at each other rather vaguely, and no
one seemed in a hurry to begin.</p>

<p>"It looks to me as if a secretary is almost a necessity,"
grinned Tom, "if nobody remembers anything
you did!"</p>

<p>"There were lots of little things that don't seem
to count when you look back on them," began Ethel
Blue.</p>

<p>"We did some things as a Club," said Roger,
"and we can tell Watkins about those without embarrassing
anybody."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our first effort was on Old First Night," said
Margaret thoughtfully. "Don't you remember we
went outside the gate and picked flowers and decorated
the stage?"</p>

<p>"In the evening James and Roger passed the baskets
to collect the offering in the Amphitheatre,"
Ethel Blue said. "And then we all did things that
helped along in the Pageant and on Recognition
Day."</p>

<p>"I don't think those really counted for much as
service," said Helen, "because they were all of them
mighty good fun."</p>

<p>"I think we ought to do whatever will help somebody,
whether we like it or not," declared Ethel
Blue, "but I don't see why we shouldn't hunt up
pleasant things to do."</p>

<p>"What are we going to do, anyway?" asked Della.
"Has anybody any ideas? Oh, please excuse me,
Helen&mdash;Miss President&mdash;perhaps it wasn't time to
ask that question."</p>

<p>"I was just about to ask for suggestions," said
Helen with dignity. "Has any one come across anything
that we can do here in Rosemont or in Glen
Point or in New York? Anything that will be an
appropriate beginning for the United Service Club?
We want to do something that would be suitable
for the children of our father and uncle who are
serving in the Army and Navy trying to keep peace
in Mexico, and of a man like Doctor Hancock, who
is serving his fellowmen in the slums every day, and
of a clergyman who is helping people to do right all
the time."</p>

<p>Helen flushed over this long speech.</p>

<p>"Rosemont, Glen Point, and New York&mdash;a wide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
field," said Tom dryly. "It seems as if we might
find something without much trouble."</p>

<p>"I thought of the orphanage in Glen Point," said
Margaret.</p>

<p>"What is there for us to do for the kids there
that the grown people don't do?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"The grown people contribute clothes and food
and all the necessaries, but sometimes when I've
been there it seemed as if the children didn't have
much of any of the little nothings that boys and girls
in their own homes have. It seemed to me that
perhaps we could make a lot of things that weren't
especially useful but were just pretty; things that
we'd like to have ourselves."</p>

<p>"I know just how they feel, I believe," said Margaret.
"One of my aunts thinks that perfectly plain
clothes are all that are necessary and she won't let
my cousins have any ruffles or bows. It makes them
just miserable. They're crazy for something that
'isn't useful.'"</p>

<p>"How would it do to get together a lot of things
for Christmas for the orphans? We might offer to
trim a tree for them. Or to give each one of them
a foolish present or a pretty one to offset the solid
things the grown-ups will give."</p>

<p>"When I was a kid," observed James, "I used to
consider it a mean fraud if I had clothing worked
off on me as Christmas presents. My parents had
to clothe me anyway; why should they put those necessities
among my Christmas gifts which were supposed
to be extras!"</p>

<p>"There you are again; what people want in this
world of pain and woe, ye-ho, he-ho," chanted
Roger, "is the things they can go without."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has any one thought of anybody else we can
benefit?" questioned Helen. "We might as well
have all the recommendations we can."</p>

<p>"There's an old couple down by the bridge on
South Street," said Roger. "I've often noticed
them. They're all bent up and about a thousand
years old. We might keep an eye on them."</p>

<p>"I know about them," contributed Ethel Brown.
"I asked about them. They have a son who takes
care of them. He gives them money every week,
so they aren't suffering, but they both have the rheumatism
frightfully so they can't go out much and I
shouldn't wonder if they'd like a party some time,
right in their own house. If we could go there and
sing them some songs and Dicky could speak his
piece about the cat and we could do some shadow
pantomimes on a sheet and then have a spread, I
believe they'd have as good a time as if they'd been
to the movies."</p>

<p>"We'll do it." Tom slapped his leg. "I'll sing
'em a solo myself."</p>

<p>Groans rose from James and Roger.</p>

<p>"Poor old things! What have you got against
them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if you're jealous of my voice&mdash;of
course I wouldn't for the world arouse any hard
feelings, Madam President. I withdraw my offer.
But mark ye, callow youths," he went on dramatically,
"the day will come when I'm a Caruso and
you'll be sorry to have to remember that you did
your best to discourage a genius that would not be
discouraged!"</p>

<p>"The meeting will come to order." Helen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
rapped for quiet, for the entire room was rocking to
and fro over Tom's praise of one of the hoarsest
voices ever given to boy or man.</p>

<p>"We'll give the old people a good show, even if
Tom does back out," cried Roger. "I wish we had
a secretary to put down these suggestions. I'm
afraid we'll forget them."</p>

<p>"So am I," agreed Helen. "Let's vote for a secretary.
Roger, pass around some paper and pencils
and let's ballot."</p>

<p>Roger did as he was bid, and Ethel Brown and
Della collected the ballots and acted as tellers.</p>

<p>"The tellers will declare the vote," announced
Helen, who had been conferring with James while
the balloting was going on, and had learned the
proper parliamentary move. Margaret had coached
Ethel Brown so that she made her report in proper
style.</p>

<p>"Total number of votes cast, eight; necessary to
a choice, five. Margaret has one, Dorothy has one,
Roger has two, Ethel Brown has one, Ethel Blue
has three. Nobody has enough."</p>

<p>"Have we got to vote over again?" Helen asked
of James.</p>

<p>"I move you, Madam President, that we consider
the person receiving the highest number of votes as
the person elected and that we make the election
unanimous."</p>

<p>"Is the motion seconded?"</p>

<p>Cries of "Yes," "I second it," "So do I," came
from all over the room and included a call from
Ethel Blue. Roger pealed with laughter.</p>

<p>"Ethel Blue means to get there," he shouted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do? What have I done?" demanded Ethel
Blue, so embarrassed at this attack that the tears
stood in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, you're the person who's receiving a unanimous
election," returned Roger, between gasps.
"You've made it unanimous, yourself, all right."</p>

<p>Poor Ethel Blue leaned back in her chair without
saying a word.</p>

<p>"Roger, you're too mean," cried Helen. "Don't
you mind a word he says, Ethel Blue. It's very hard
to follow votes and it isn't at all surprising that you
didn't understand."</p>

<p>"What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"It means that you're elected secretary."</p>

<p>"But there weren't enough votes."</p>

<p>"You had three and Roger had two, and nobody
else had more than one. When one candidate has
more than the rest he may be considered as elected,
even if he didn't get the right number of votes&mdash;that
is, if everybody agrees to it."</p>

<p>"And you agreed to it," chuckled Roger.</p>

<p>"Stop, Roger. You're our new secretary, Ethel
Blue, and it's very suitable that you should be, for
the club was your idea and you ought to be an officer.
Roger, give Ethel Blue your pencil and the
rest of that paper you had for the ballots. Come
and sit next to me, Ethel."</p>

<p>Ethel Blue felt that honors were being thrust upon
her much against her will, but she was afraid that
she would make some other mistake if she objected,
so she meekly took the pencil and paper from Roger
and began to note down the proceedings.</p>

<p>"We've had a suggestion from Glen Point and
one from Rosemont&mdash;let's hear from New York,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
said the president. "Della&mdash;anything to say?"</p>

<p>"Papa can suggest lots of people that we can help
if we ask him," said Della. "I didn't ask him because
I thought that perhaps you'd have some pet
charities out here where there aren't so many helping
hands as there are in New York."</p>

<p>"How about you, Tom?"</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth," responded Tom gravely,
"I didn't think up anything to suggest this afternoon
because my mind has been so full of the war that
I can't seem able to think about anything else."</p>

<p>Everybody grew serious at once. The war
seemed very close to the Mortons, although it was a
war across the sea, because they knew what it would
mean to their father and uncle if ever our country
should be involved in war. The thought of their
own mental suffering and their anxiety if Captain
and Lieutenant Morton should ever be sent to the
front had given them a keen interest in what had
been going on in Europe for six weeks.</p>

<p>"I read the newspapers all the time," went on
Tom, "and I dare say I don't gain much real information
from them, but at least I'm having ground
into my soul every day the hideous suffering that all
this fighting is bringing upon the women and children.
The men may die, but at least they can fight for
their lives. The women and children have to sit
down and wait for death or destruction to come their
way."</p>

<p>"It's too big a situation for us way off here to
grasp," said Roger slowly, "but there are people on
the spot who are trying to give assistance, and if
Americans could only get in touch with them it seems
as if help might be handed along the way we handed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the water buckets last summer when the cottage was
on fire."</p>

<p>"The Red Cross is working in all the countries
that are at war," said Helen. "There's an American
Red Cross and people are sending clothing and
food to the New York branch and they are sending
them on to Europe. That's Roger's bucket brigade
idea."</p>

<p>"Why don't we work for the Red Cross?" asked
Della.</p>

<p>"I saw in the paper a plan that seems better still
for us youngsters," said Ethel Blue. "Some people
are going to send over a Christmas ship with thousands
and thousands of presents for the orphans and
the other children all over Europe. Why don't we
work for that? For the Santa Claus Ship?"</p>

<p>"'Charity begins at home,'" demurred Margaret.</p>

<p>"We needn't forget the Glen Point orphans. The
Christmas Ship is going to sail early in November
and we'll have plenty of time after she gets off to
carry out those other schemes that we've spoken of."</p>

<p>"I'd like to move," said Ethel Brown, getting on
to her feet to make her action more impressive,
"that the United Service Club devote itself first to
preparing a bundle to send off on the Christmas Ship.
After that's done we can see what comes next."</p>

<p>"Does any one second the motion, that we work
first for the Christmas Ship?" asked Helen.</p>

<p>Every voice in the room cried "I do."</p>

<p>"All in favor?" There was a chorus of "Ayes."</p>

<p>"Contrary minded?" Not a sound arose.</p>

<p>"It's a unanimous vote that we start right in on
the bundle for the Santa Claus Ship."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FINANCIAL PLANS</div>


<div class='cap'>"This parliamentary business fusses me," exclaimed
Helen. "Let's just talk, now that
we've decided what we are going to do."</div>

<p>"Take a more comfortable chair," suggested Tom,
pulling over a Morris chair nearer the fire.</p>

<p>Roger stirred up the flames and tossed on some
pine cones.</p>

<p>"These cones remind me that our old people down
by the bridge might like some. They have a funny
open stove that they could use them in."</p>

<p>"What are they good for? Kindling?" asked
Della.</p>

<p>"Ha! There speaks the city lady used only to
steam! Certainly they are good for kindling on
account of the pitch that's in them, but they're also
great in an open fire to brighten it up when it is sinking
somewhat and one or two at a time tossed on
to a clear fire make a pretty sight."</p>

<p>"And a pretty snapping sound," added Dorothy,
remembering the cones from the long leaf pines.</p>

<p>"Our old couple gets a bushel on Monday afternoon
if it ever stops raining," promised Roger.
"Dicky loves to pick them up, so he'll help."</p>

<p>"The honorary member of the United Service
Club does his share of service work right nobly," declared
James, who was a great friend of Dicky's.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"The thing for us to do first is to decide how we
are to begin," said Helen.</p>

<p>"We might talk over the kinds of presents that
the war orphans would like and then see which of
them any of us can make," suggested Margaret
wisely.</p>

<p>"Any sort of clothing would come in mighty handy,
I should think," guessed James, "and I don't believe
the orphans would have my early prejudices against
receiving it for Christmas gifts."</p>

<p>"Poor little creatures, I rather suspect Santa Claus
will be doing his heaviest work with clothing this
year."</p>

<p>"As far as clothing is concerned," said Margaret,
"we needn't put a limit on the amount we send or the
sizes or the kinds. The distributors will be able to
use everything they can lay their hands on when the
Christmas Ship comes in and for many months later."</p>

<p>"Then let's inquire of our mothers what there is
stowed away that we can have and let's look over
our own things and weed out all we can that would
be at all suitable and that our mothers will let us
give away, and report here at the next meeting."</p>

<p>"While we're talking about the next meeting,"
broke in Dorothy while the others were nodding their
assent to Helen's proposition, "won't you please
come to my house next time?"</p>

<p>"We certainly will," agreed Della and Margaret.</p>

<p>"You bet," came from the boys.</p>

<p>"And Mother told me to offer the Club the use of
our attic to store our stuff in. It's a big place with
almost nothing in it."</p>

<p>"I'm sure Aunt Marion will be glad not to have
anything else go into her attic," said Ethel Blue, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
all the Mortons laughed as they thought of the condition
of the Morton attic, whose walls were almost
bulging with its contents.</p>

<p>"If that's settled we must remember to address
all our bundles to 'Mrs. Leonard Smith, Church
Street, Rosemont,'" James reminded them.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," Ethel Brown said slowly, thinking
as she spoke, "that we might collect more clothing
than we shall be able to find in our own families."</p>

<p>"There are a good many of us," suggested Della.</p>

<p>"There are two Watkinses and two Hancocks and
five Mortons and one Smith&mdash;that's ten, but if the
rest of you are like the Morton family&mdash;we wear
our clothes pretty nearly down to the bone."</p>

<p>All the Mortons pealed at this and the rest could
not help joining in.</p>

<p>"One thing we must not do," declared Helen.
"We must not send a single old thing that isn't in
perfect order. It's a poor present that you have to
sit down and mend."</p>

<p>"We certainly won't," agreed Margaret. "I wear
my clothes almost down to the skeleton, too, but I
know I have some duds that I can make over into
dresses for small children. I'm gladder every
day that we took that sewing course last summer,
Helen."</p>

<p>"Me, too. My dresses&mdash;or what's left of them&mdash;usually
adorn Ethel Brown's graceful frame, but
perhaps Mother will let us have for the orphans the
clothes that would ordinarily go to Ethel Brown."</p>

<p>Ethel Brown looked worried.</p>

<p>"Ethel Brown doesn't know whether that will
mean that she'll have to go without or whether she'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
have new clothes instead of the hand-me-downs,"
laughed Roger.</p>

<p>"I don't care," cried Ethel Brown. "I'd just as
lief go without new clothes if Mother will let the
Club have the money they'd cost."</p>

<p>"I've been thinking," said Tom, "that we're going
to need money to work this undertaking through successfully.
How are we going to get it?"</p>

<p>"But shall we need any to speak of?" inquired
Margaret. "Fixing up our old clothes won't cost
more than we can meet ourselves out of our allowances.
I'm going to ask my Aunt Susy to let me
have some of the girls' old things. The girls will
be delighted; they're the ones who have the plain
clothes."</p>

<p>"We'll fix them up with ruffles and bows before
we send them away," smiled Helen.</p>

<p>"Why can't we ask everybody we come across for
old clothes?" Ethel Blue wondered.</p>

<p>"Grandmother Emerson would be sure to have
something in her attic and I shouldn't wonder if
she'd be willing to ask the ladies at the Guild if
they'd contribute," said Helen.</p>

<p>"Do we want to take things from outside of the
Club?" objected Ethel Brown.</p>

<p>"I don't see why not," answered Margaret. "The
idea is to get together for the orphans as many presents
as possible, no matter where they come from.
We're serving the orphans if we work as collectors
just as much as if we made the clothes ourselves."</p>

<p>"Right-o," agreed Roger. "Let's tackle everybody
we can on the old clo' question. We can ask
the societies in our churches&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not in all the churches in town?" dared
Ethel Blue.</p>

<p>The idea brought a pause, for the place was small
enough for the churches to meet each other with an
occasional rub.</p>

<p>"I believe that's a good idea," declared Tom, and
as a clergyman's son they listened to his views with
respect. "All the churches ought to be willing to
come together on the neutral ground of this club
and if we are willing to take the responsibility of
doing the gathering and the packing and the expressing
to the Christmas Ship I believe they'll be
glad to do just the rummaging in their attics and
the mending up."</p>

<p>"We needn't limit their offerings to clothes,
either," said Della. "We'll take care of anything
they'll send in."</p>

<p>"Let's put it up to them, I say," cried Roger.
"There's at least one member of the Morton family
in every society in our church and we ought to get
the subject before every one of those groups of people
by the end of next week and start things booming."</p>

<p>"We'll do the same at Glen Point," agreed Margaret.</p>

<p>"I can't promise quite as much for New York,
because I don't know what Father's plans are for
war relief work in his church, but I do feel pretty
sure he'll suggest some way of helping us," said
Della.</p>

<p>"That's decided, then&mdash;we'll lay our paws on
everything we can get from every source," Tom
summed up the discussion. "Now I come back to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
what I said a few minutes ago&mdash;I think we're going
to need more money to run this association than
we're going to be able to rake up out of our own allowances,
unless Margaret's is a good deal bigger
than mine," and he nodded toward Margaret, who
had objected to the more-money idea when he had
offered it before.</p>

<p>"Just tell me how we'll need more," insisted Margaret.</p>

<p>"I figure it out that the part we boys will have
to do in this transaction will be to district this town
and Glen Point and make a house to house appeal
for clothes and any sort of thing that would do for
a Christmas present, all to be sent to Mrs. Smith's."</p>

<p>"That won't cost anything but a few carfares, and
you can stand those," insisted Margaret.</p>

<p>"Carfares are all right and even a few express
charges for some people who for some reason aren't
able to deliver their parcels at Mrs. Smith's house.
But if you girls are going to make over some of these
clothes and perhaps make new garments you'll need
some cash to buy materials with."</p>

<p>"Perhaps some of the dry goods people will contribute
the materials."</p>

<p>"Maybe they will. But you mark my words&mdash;the
cost of a little here and a little there mounts up
amazingly in work of this sort and I know we're
going to need cash."</p>

<p>"Tom's right," confirmed Della. "He's helped
Father enough to know."</p>

<p>The idea of needing money, which they did not
have, was depressing to the club members who sat
around the fire staring into it gloomily.</p>

<p>"The question is, how to get it," went on Tom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"People might give us money just as well as
cloth, I suppose," suggested Margaret.</p>

<p>"I think it would be a thousand times more fun to
make the money ourselves," said Ethel Blue.</p>

<p>"The infant's right," cried Tom. "It will be
more fun and what's more important still, nobody
can boss us because he's given us a five dollar bill."</p>

<p>"I suppose somebody might try," murmured
Helen.</p>

<p>"They would," cried Tom and Della in concert.</p>

<p>"We aren't a clergyman's children for nothing,"
Tom went on humorously. "The importance a five
dollar bill can have in the eyes of the giver and
the way it swells in size as it leaves his hands is something
that few people realize who haven't seen it
happen."</p>

<p>"Let's be independent," cried Dorothy decidedly,
and her wish was evidently to the mind of all the rest,
for murmurs of approval went around the room.</p>

<p>"But if we're so high and mighty as not to take
money contributions and if we nevertheless need
money, what in the mischief are we going to do
about it?" inquired Roger.</p>

<p>"We must earn it," said Helen. "I'll contribute
the money Mother is going to pay me for making a
dozen middy blouses for the Ethels. She ordered
them from me last summer when I began to take
the sewing course and I haven't quite finished them
yet, but I'll have the last one done this week if I can
get home from school promptly for a day or two."</p>

<p>"I can make some baskets for the Woman's Exchange,"
said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I learned how to make Lady Baltimore cake the
other day," said Margaret, "and I'll go to some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
ladies in Glen Point who are going to have teas
soon and ask them for orders."</p>

<p>"I can make cookies," murmured Ethel Brown,
"but I don't know who'd buy them."</p>

<p>"You tell the kids at school that you've gone into
the cooky business and you'll have all the work you
can do for a while," prophesied Roger. "I know
your cookies; they're bully."</p>

<p>"I don't notice that we boys are mentioning any
means of making money," remarked James dryly.
"I confess I'm stumped."</p>

<p>"I know what you can do," suggested Margaret.
"Father said this morning that he was going to get
a chauffeur next week if he could find one that
wouldn't rob him of all the money he made. You
can run the car&mdash;why don't you offer to work half
time&mdash;afternoons after school, for half pay? That
would help Father and he'd rather have you than a
strange man."</p>

<p>"He'd rather have half time, too. He likes to
run the car himself, only he gets tired running it all
day on heavy days. Great head, Sis," and James
made a gesture of stroking his sister's locks, to which
she responded by making a face.</p>

<p>"I know what I can do," said Roger. "You know
those bachelor girls about seventy-five apiece, over
on Church Street near Aunt Louise's&mdash;the Miss
Clarks? Well, they had an awful time last year
getting their furnace attended to regularly. They
had one man who proved to be a&mdash;er," Roger hesitated.</p>

<p>"Not a total abstainer?" inquired James elegantly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Brother Hancock, for the use of
your vocabulary. The next one stole the washing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
off the line, and the next one&mdash;Oh, I don't know
what he did, but the Miss Clarks were in a state of
mind over the furnace and the furnace man all winter.
Now, suppose I offer to take care of their furnace
for them this winter? I believe they'd have
me."</p>

<p>"I think they'd be mighty glad to get you," confirmed
Helen. "Could you do that and take care
of ours, too?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing, if I put my mind on it and don't
chase off with the fellows every time I feel in the
mood."</p>

<p>"Mother would like to have you take care of ours
if you could manage three," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I'll do it," and Roger thumped his knee with decision.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't undertake too much," warned Helen.
"It will mean a visit three times a day at each house,
you know, and the last one pretty late in the evening."</p>

<p>"I'm game," insisted Roger. "You know I can
be as steady as an old horse when I put my alleged
mind on it. Mother never had any kick coming
over my work in the furnace department last winter."</p>

<p>"She said you did it splendidly, but this means
three times as much."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," and Roger nodded his head solemnly.</p>

<p>"It seems to be up to Della and me to tell what
we can do," said Tom meditatively. "Father's secretary
is away on a three months' holiday and I'm
doing his typewriting for him and some other office
stunts&mdash;as much as I can manage out of school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
hours. I'll turn over my pay to the Club treasury."</p>

<p>This was greeted with applause.</p>

<p>"I don't seem to have any accomplishments,"
sighed Della, her round head on one side. "The
only thing I can think of is that I heard the ladies
who have charge of the re-furnishing of the Rest
Room in the Parish House say that they were going
to find some one to stencil the window curtains. I
might see if they'd let me do it and pay me. I
didn't take that class at the Girls' Club last summer,
but Dorothy and Ethel Brown could teach me."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Or you could get the order from them, I'd fill
it, and you could make the baskets for the Woman's
Exchange," offered Dorothy.</p>

<p>Della brightened. That was a better arrangement.</p>

<p>"Try it," nodded Tom. "If you turn out one
order well you'll get more; see if you don't."</p>

<p>"Our honorary member, Mr. Dicky Morton,
might sell newspapers since he got broken in to that
business last summer," laughed Ethel Brown.
"Mother wouldn't let him do it here, I know, but
he can weave awfully pretty things that he learned
at the kindergarten and if there are any bazars
this fall he could sell some of them on commission."</p>

<p>"Dicky really understands about the Club. I
think he'd like to do something for the orphans,"
Helen agreed.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," announced Ethel Blue,
rising in her excitement; "I have a perfectly grand,
galoptious idea. Why do we wait for somebody
else to get up a bazar to sell Dicky's weaving? Let's
have a bazar of our own. Why can't we have a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
fair with some tables, and ice cream and cake for
sale and an entertainment of some kind in the evening?
We all know all sorts of stunts; we can do
the whole thing ourselves. If we announce that we
are doing it for the Christmas Ship I believe everybody
in town would come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;And in Glen Point and New York," Roger
mocked her enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"You know we could fill the School Hall as easy
as fiddle, Roger. You see everybody would know
what we were at work on because we are going to
begin collecting the clothes right off, so everybody
will be interested."</p>

<p>Tom nodded approval.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can do the advertising act when we
do the collecting."</p>

<p>"If I drive Father, I see myself ringing up all the
neighboring houses while he's in on his case," said
James, "and it's just as easy to talk bazar part of
the time as it is to chat old clo' the whole time."</p>

<p>"Can you get the School Hall free?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"We'd have to pay for the lighting and the janitor,
but that wouldn't be much," said Roger. "It
would be better than the Parish House of any of the
churches because if we had it in a church there'd
surely be some people who wouldn't go because it
was in a building belonging to a denomination they
didn't approve of, but no one can make any kick
about the schoolhouse."</p>

<p>"It's the natural neighborhood centre."</p>

<p>"We'll have the whole town there."</p>

<p>"If we let in some of the school kids we'll get
all their families on the string," recommended Roger.</p>

<p>"I'm working up a feat that I've never seen any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
one do," said Tom. "I'll turn it loose for the first
time at our show."</p>

<p>"Remember, you're all coming to me next Saturday
afternoon," Dorothy reminded them as the
Hancocks and Watkinses put on their overgarments
and sought out their umbrellas preparatory to going
home.</p>

<p>"And we'll bring a list of what we can contribute
ourselves and what we've collected so far and what
we think we can collect and we'll turn in anything
we've made."</p>

<p>"If there's anything we can work on while the
Club is going on we'd better bring it," suggested
Helen.</p>

<p>"Mother says we may have the sewing machine
in the attic," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I believe I'll take my jig-saw over," suggested
Roger. "Aunt Louise wouldn't mind, would she?"</p>

<p>"She'd be delighted. Bring everything," and
Dorothy glowed with the hospitality that had been
bottled up in her for years and until now had had but
small opportunity to escape.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ROGER GOES FORAGING</div>


<div class='cap'>ALTHOUGH Helen never had been president
of any club before, yet she had seen enough
of a number of associations in the high school and
the church to understand the advantage of striking
while the iron of enthusiasm was hot. For that
reason she and Roger worked out the districting of
Rosemont before they went to bed that night, and
the next afternoon Roger went over to Glen Point
on his bicycle, and, with James's help, did the same
for that town. It was understood that Tom would
not be able to come out again until Saturday, but
he had agreed to be on hand early in the morning
to do a good half day of canvassing. The girls
were to speak to every one to whom they could bring
up the subject conveniently, wherever they met them.</div>

<p>Roger began his work on Monday afternoon after
school. He wheeled over to a part of the town
where he did not know many people, his idea being
that since that would be the most disagreeable place
to tackle he would do it first and get it over with.
He was a merry boy, with a pleasant way of speaking
that won him friends at once, and he was not
bothered with shyness, but he did hesitate for an instant
at his first house. It was large and he thought
that the owner ought to be prosperous enough to
have plenty of old clothes lying about crying to be
sent to the war orphans.</p>

<p>It was a maid whose grasp on the English language<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
was a trifle uncertain who opened the door.
Roger stated his desire.</p>

<p>"Old clothes?" she repeated after him. "I've no
old clothes to give you," and she shut the door
hastily.</p>

<p>Roger stood still with astonishment as if he were
fastened to the upper step. Then his feelings
stirred.</p>

<p>"The idiot!" he gasped. "She thought I wanted
them for myself," and he looked down at his suit
with a sudden realization that his long ride over one
dusty road and a spill on another that had recently
been oiled had not improved the appearance of his
attire. However, he rang the bell again vigorously.
The woman seemed somewhat disconcerted
when she saw him still before her.</p>

<p>"I don't want the clothes&mdash;" began Roger.</p>

<p>"What did you say you did for?" inquired the
maid sharply, and again she slammed the door.</p>

<p>By this time Roger's persistency was roused. He
made up his mind that he was going to make himself
understood even if he did not secure a contribution.
Once more he rang the bell.</p>

<p>"You here!" almost screamed the girl as she saw
once more his familiar face. "Why don't you go?
I've nothing to give you."</p>

<p>"Look here," insisted Roger, his toe in the way
of the door's shutting completely when she should
try to slam it again; "look here, you don't understand
what I want. Is your mistress at home?"</p>

<p>The girl was afraid to say that she was not, so
she nodded.</p>

<p>"Tell her I want to see her."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"I'm Roger Morton, son of Lieutenant Morton.
I live on Cedar Street. Can you remember that?"</p>

<p>She could not, but her ear had caught the military
title and upstairs she conveyed the impression that at
least a general was waiting at the door. When the
mistress of the house appeared Roger pulled off his
cap politely, and he was such a frank-faced boy that
she knew at once that her maid's fears had been unnecessary,
though she did not see where the military
title came in. Roger explained who he was and
what he wanted at sufficient length, and he was rewarded
for his persistency by the promise of a bundle.</p>

<p>"I know your grandmother, Mrs. Emerson,"
said the lady, who had mentioned that she was Mrs.
Warburton, "and your aunt, Mrs. Smith, has hired
one of my houses, so I am glad on their account to
help your enterprise, though of course its own appeal
is enough."</p>

<p>Roger thanked her and took the precaution to inquire
the names of her neighbors, before he presented
himself at another door. He also reached
such a pitch of friendliness that he borrowed a whisk
broom from Mrs. Warburton and redeemed his
clothes from the condition which had brought him
into such disfavor with the maid-servant.</p>

<p>There was no one at home in the next house, but
the next after that yielded a parcel which the old
lady whom he interviewed said that he might have
if he would take it away immediately.</p>

<p>"I might change my mind if you don't," she said.
"I've been studying for ten days whether to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
over that dress with black silk or dark blue velvet.
If I give the dress away I shan't be worried about it
any longer."</p>

<p>"Very well," cried Roger, and he rolled the frock
up as small as he could and fastened it to his handle
bars.</p>

<p>There was no one at home at the next house, but
the woman who came to the door at the next after
that listened to his story with moist eyes.</p>

<p>"Come in," she said. "I can give you a great
many garments. In fact there are so many that perhaps
I'd better send them."</p>

<p>"Very well," returned Roger. "Please send
them to my aunt's," and he gave the address.</p>

<p>"You see," hesitated Roger's hostess, now frankly
wiping her eyes, "I had a little daughter about ten
years old, and&mdash;and I never have been willing to
part with her little dresses and coats, but how could
I place them better than now?"</p>

<p>Roger swallowed hard.</p>

<p>"I guess she'd like to have 'em go over there," he
stammered, and he was very glad when he escaped
from the house, though he told his mother, "she
seemed kind of glad to talk about the kid, so I didn't
mind much."</p>

<p>"Count listening as one of the Club services," replied
Mrs. Morton.</p>

<p>Back in his own part of town Roger felt that his
trip had been profitable. A very fair number of
garments and bundles had been promised, and he
had told everybody he could to watch the local paper
for the announcement of the entertainment to be
given by the U. S. C.</p>

<p>"Everybody seemed interested," he reported at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
home. "I don't believe we'll have a mite of trouble
in getting an audience."</p>

<p>It was at a cottage not far from the high school
that Roger came upon his nearest approach to an
adventure. When he touched the buzzer the door
was opened by an elderly woman who spoke with a
marked German accent. Roger explained his errand.
To his horror the woman burst into tears.
When he made a gesture of withdrawal she stopped
him.</p>

<p>"My son&mdash;my son is mit de army," she exclaimed
brokenly. "My son und de betrothed of my daughter.
We cannot go to the Fatherland. The German
ships go no more. If we go on an English or
French ship we are kept in England. Here must we
stay&mdash;here."</p>

<p>"You're safe here, at any rate," responded Roger,
at a loss what reply to make that would be soothing
in the face of such depressing facts.</p>

<p>"Safe!" retorted the woman scornfully. "Who
cares to be safe? A woman's place is mit her men
when they are in danger. My daughter and I&mdash;we
should be in Germany and we cannot get there!"</p>

<p>"It's surely a shame if you want to go as much as
that," returned Roger gently, and just then to his
surprise there came through an inner door a young
woman whom he recognized as his German teacher
in the high school, Fr&auml;ulein Hindenburg. Her face
was disfigured with weeping and he knew now why
she had seemed so ill and listless in her classes.</p>

<p>"You must not mind Mother," she said, looking
surprised as she saw one of her pupils before her.
"It is true that we would go if we could but we cannot,
so we must stay here and wait."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Roger explained his errand.</p>

<p>"To work for the war orphans of all countries?"
cried both women excitedly. "Gladly! Gladly!"</p>

<p>"We are knitting every day&mdash;scarfs, socks, wristlets,"
said the older woman. "Also will we so
gladly make clothing for the children and toys and
playthings&mdash;what we can."</p>

<p>Fr&auml;ulein smiled a sad assent and Roger wheeled
off, realizing that the pain caused by the war no
longer existed for him only in his imagination; he
had seen its tears.</p>

<p>So freely had people responded to Roger's appeal
that he began to wonder how the Club was going to
take care of all the garments that would soon be
coming in. After that thought came into his mind
he made a point of asking the givers if they would
send their offerings as far as possible in condition
to be shipped.</p>

<p>"Margaret and Helen can make over some of the
clothes and the Ethels and Dorothy can help with
the simple things, I suppose, but if there are many
grown-up dresses like this one on my handle bar
they won't have time to do anything else but dressmake,"
meditated Roger as he pedalled along.</p>

<p>Nowhere did he meet with a rebuff. Every one
was pleased to be asked. Many offered to make
new garments. One old woman who lived in a
wheel-chair but who could use her hands, agreed to
sew if the material should be sent her. Many mothers
seemed to consider it a Heaven-sent opportunity
to make a clearance of the nursery toys though
Roger stoutly insisted that they must all be in working
order before they were turned in.</p>

<p>"It's been perfectly splendid," breathed Roger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
joyfully as he finished his third afternoon and came
into the house to report to his mother and Helen.
"It's a delight to ask when you feel sure that you
won't have to coax as you usually do when you're
getting up anything. Everybody seems to jump at
the chance."</p>

<p>Toward the end of the week Ethel Blue came in
beaming.</p>

<p>"I've got some entirely new people interested,"
she cried.</p>

<p>"Who? Who?"</p>

<p>"The last people you'd ever think of&mdash;the women
in the Old Ladies' Home."</p>

<p>"Why should you think them the very last to be
interested?" asked Mrs. Emerson who happened to
be at the Mortons' and whose fingers were carrying
the flying yarn that her needles were manufacturing
into a sock. "Most of them are mothers and it
doesn't take a mother to be interested in such a
cause as this. Every human being who has any
imagination must feel for the sufferings of the poor
children."</p>

<p>"It seemed queer to me because I've never seen
them do anything but just sit there with their hands
in their laps."</p>

<p>"Poor souls, nobody ever provides them with anything
to do."</p>

<p>"Now all of them say that they'll be delighted to
sew or knit or do anything they can if the materials
are provided for them."</p>

<p>"Here's where we can begin to spend the money
Mother has offered to advance us," cried Ethel
Brown. "Can't we go right after school to-morrow
and buy the yarn for them, Mother?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed you may. Has Della sent you the knitting
rules from the Red Cross yet?"</p>

<p>"We're expecting them in every mail. If they
don't come before we take the wool to the Home we
can start the ladies on scarfs. They're just straight
pieces."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hindenburg and Fr&auml;ulein are knitting wristlets
for the German soldiers. They could give the
rule for them, I should think," suggested Roger,
"and our old lady friends can just cut it in halves for
the kids."</p>

<p>It was the next day that Helen came in from
school all excitement.</p>

<p>"I've made a discovery as thrilling as Roger's
about Fr&auml;ulein!" she cried.</p>

<p>"What? Who is it about? Tell us."</p>

<p>"It's about Mademoiselle Millerand."</p>

<p>"Your French teacher?" asked Mrs. Emerson.</p>

<p>"She was new at school last year and you've heard
us say she's the most fascinating little black-eyed
creature."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she can't talk fast!" added Roger.</p>

<p>"What's the story about her?" demanded Ethel
Brown.</p>

<p>"It's not a romantic story like Fr&auml;ulein's; that is,
there's no betrothed on the other side that she's crazy
to get to; but she's going over to join the French
Red Cross."</p>

<p>"That little thing!" cried Roger. "Why she
doesn't look as if she had strength enough to last
out a week!"</p>

<p>"She says she's had a year's training in nursing
and that a nurse is taught to conserve her strength.
She hopes she'll be sent to the front."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"The plucky little creature! When is she going?"</p>

<p>"As soon as she can put in a substitute at the
school; she doesn't want to leave us in the lurch after
she made a contract for the year."</p>

<p>"It may take some time after that to arrange for a
sailing, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so. Any way I think it would be nice
if we gave her a send-off&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just as we will Fr&auml;ulein if her chance comes."</p>

<p>"We can make some travelling comforts."</p>

<p>"She won't be able to carry much," warned Mrs.
Morton.</p>

<p>"Everything will have to be as small as possible,
but we can hunt up the smallest size of everything.
I think it will be fun!"</p>

<p>"She'll probably be very much pleased."</p>

<p>"I wish there was something rather special we
could do for Fr&auml;ulein too, so we could be perfectly
impartial."</p>

<p>"Watch for the chance to do something extra nice
for her. She's having the harder time of the two;
it's always harder to stay and wait than it is to go
into action, even when the action is dangerous."</p>

<p>While the Mortons were canvassing Rosemont,
James and Margaret were doing the same work in
Glen Point. Dr. Hancock had accepted his son's
offer and James was now regularly engaged as his
father's chauffeur, working after school hours every
school day and on Saturday mornings. The Doctor
insisted that he should have Saturday afternoons free
so that he might go to the Club. He was also quite
willing that James should follow the plan he had
sketched at the last Club meeting and visit the
neighbors of his father's patients while Doctor Hancock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
was making his professional calls. The plan
worked to a charm and James found Glen Point
quite as ready as Rosemont to respond to the "bitter
cry of the children."</p>

<p>"So many people are getting interested I almost
feel as if it weren't our affair any longer," James
complained to his father as they were driving home
in the dusk one afternoon.</p>

<p>"Look out for that corner. That's a bad habit
you have of shaving the curbstone. You needn't
feel that way as long as your club is doing all the
organizing and administration. That's the part that
seems to make most people hesitate about doing good
works. It isn't actual work they balk at; it's leadership."</p>

<p>"If handling the stuff and disposing of it is leadership
then we're a 'going concern' all right," declared
James. "Roger telephoned over this morning that
the bundles were coming in to Mrs. Smith's at a great
rate, and that a lot of people were making new garments
and things that will turn up later."</p>

<p>"When is Tom coming out?"</p>

<p>"Saturday morning. I've saved one district for
him to do then and that will finish up Glen Point as
Roger and I sketched it out."</p>

<p>"It hasn't been so hard a job as you thought."</p>

<p>"Chasing round in the car has saved time. This
is a bully job of yours, Dad."</p>

<p>"You won't hold it long if you cut corners like
that, I warn you again."</p>

<p>"I'll try to cut 'em <i>out</i>," laughed James as he carefully
turned into the Hancocks' avenue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>IN THE SMITH ATTIC</div>


<div class='cap'>"GRANDFATHER EMERSON wants to give
the Club a present," cried Ethel Brown as
the last arrivals, the Hancocks, came up the stairs
and entered the attic of Dorothy's house on Saturday
afternoon.</div>

<p>The large room was half the width of the whole
cottage and, with its low windows and sloping roof
had a quaint appearance that was increased by its
furnishing of tables and seats made from boxes
covered with gay bits of chintz. Dorothy had not
neglected her work for the orphans but she had found
time to fit up the meeting place of the U. S. C. so
that its members might not have to gather in bare
surroundings. The afternoon sun shone brightly in
through simple curtains of white cheesecloth, the sewing
machine awaited Helen beside a window with a
clear north light, and Roger's jig-saw was in a favorable
position in a corner. Each one who came up the
stairs gave an "Oh" of pleasure as the door opened
upon this comfortable, cheerful room where there
was nothing too good to be used and nothing too bad
to have entrance to the society of beauty-loving folk.
"What did your grandfather give us?" asked Margaret.</p>

<p>"Grandfather has been awfully interested in the
Club from the very beginning, you know. The other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
day he asked if we wouldn't like to have him give us
club pins with our emblem on them."</p>

<p>"How perfectly dear of him!" ejaculated Delia.</p>

<p>"Don't let your hopes rise too high. I said it
would be simply fine to have little forget-me-not pins
like those we talked about at our very first meeting
in the ravine at Chautauqua&mdash;do you remember?"</p>

<p>"Blue enamel," murmured Dorothy.</p>

<p>"He said he wanted us to have them, and that it
was a lovely symbol and so on, and he'd seen some
ducks of pins in New York that were just what we'd
like, and some single flower ones for the boys&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Um. This suspense is wearing on me," remarked
Roger.</p>

<p>"We talked it over and the way it came out was
that Grandfather said that perhaps he'd better give
us now the money the pins would cost and keep his
present for later."</p>

<p>No one could resist a groan.</p>

<p>"He won't forget it. Grandfather never forgets
to do what he promises. We'll get them some time
or other. But I had a feeling that we'd like them
later better even than now because we'd feel then that
we'd really earned them after the Club had done
something worth while, you know."</p>

<p>"I suppose we will," sighed Della, "but they do
sound good to me."</p>

<p>"He was bound that we should have the forget-me-not
in some form or other," went on Ethel Brown,
"and he's sent us a rubber stamp with 'U. S. C.'
on it and a forget-me-not at each end of the initials.
There's an indelible pad that goes with it and we are
to stamp everything we send out on some part where
it won't be too conspicuous."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will be like signing a letter to the child the
present goes to," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Isn't he a darling!" exclaimed Ethel Blue. "I
love him as much as if he were my own grandfather."</p>

<p>"He turned the money right over into my hand,"
continued Ethel Brown&mdash;"the money he didn't spend
for the pins, I mean. It's fifteen dollars. What
shall I do with it?"</p>

<p>"Pay for the yarn you bought for the women in
the Old Ladies' Home to knit with," said Helen
promptly.</p>

<p>"'"The time has come," the walrus said,'" quoted
Tom, "when we must have a treasurer. It was all
very well talking about not needing one when we
didn't have a cent of money, but now we are on the
way toward being multis and we can't get on any
longer without some one to look after it."</p>

<p>"Let's make Tom treasurer and then he can fuss
over the old accounts himself," suggested Roger.</p>

<p>Roger's loathing for keeping accounts was so well
known that every one laughed.</p>

<p>"Not I," objected Tom. "I'm not at all the right
one. It ought to be one of you people who live out
here where we're going to do our work. You'll have
hurry calls for cash very often and it would be a
nuisance to have to wait a day to write or phone me.
No, sir, Roger's the feller for that job."</p>

<p>"No, Roger isn't," persisted that young man disgustedly.
"I buck, I kick, I remonstrate, I protest,
I refuse."</p>

<p>"Here, here," called Ethel Blue. "Who said you
could have James's vocabulary?"</p>

<p>"Well, James, then," said Tom. "It doesn't
make much difference who it is as long as he lives in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
these precincts and not as far away as I do. Madam
President, I nominate Mr. Hancock for treasurer
of the United Service Club."</p>

<p>"You hear the nomination," responded Helen.
"Is it seconded?"</p>

<p>"I second it with both hands and an equal number
of feet," replied Roger enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Now is the opportunity for a discussion of the
merits of the candidate," observed Helen drily.</p>

<p>"There are many things that might be said," rejoined
Dorothy, "but because it would probably embarrass
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, say!" came from James. "Are they as bad
as that?"</p>

<p>"As I was remarking when I was interrupted,"
continued Dorothy severely, "because it might make
the candidate feel queer if he were to hear all the
compliments we should pay him, I think we won't
say anything."</p>

<p>"I'll trust old Roger not to pay compliments," responded
James.</p>

<p>"Old Roger is in such a good humor because this
job is being worked off on to your shoulders instead
of his that he might utter some blandishments that
would surprise you."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't risk it!"</p>

<p>"Are you ready to vote?" asked Helen.</p>

<p>"We are," came ringing back, and the resulting
ballot placed James in the treasurership, the only
dissenting vote being his own. His first official act
after the money was put into his hands was to give
it back to Ethel Brown in part repayment of the sum
which her mother had advanced for the yarn for the
Old Ladies' Home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here's another bundle," announced Mrs. Smith,
appearing with a large parcel as the Club members
were looking over the collection that had come in.
All the contributions were piled in a corner, and
already they made a considerable mound.</p>

<p>"Roger will have to apply some of his scientific
management ideas to that mass of stuff," laughed
Mrs. Smith.</p>

<p>"I wish we could spread them out so that we could
get an idea of what is which."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we boys make some sort of rack divided
into cubes or even knock together a set of plain
shelves? That would lift them off the floor."</p>

<p>"I wish you would," said Helen. "Then we ought
to put a tag on each bundle telling who sent it and
what is in it."</p>

<p>"And what we think can be done with it, if it isn't
in condition to send off just as it is," added Ethel
Brown.</p>

<p>"I believe I saw some planks in the cellar that
would make sufficiently good shelves for what you
need," said Mrs. Smith. "Suppose you boys go down
stairs with me and take a look at them while the girls
are making out the tags."</p>

<p>So the boys trooped after their hostess while Ethel
Brown unscrewed the cap of her fountain pen and
wrote on the tags that Dorothy cut out of cardboard,
and Ethel Blue fitted them with strings, so that they
might be tied on to the parcels.</p>

<p>"These dresses and coats came from Mrs. Ames,"
said Helen. "They belonged to her daughter who
died, and they're all right for a child of ten, so we'll
just mark the bundle, 'From Mrs. Ames,' and 'O.K.,'
and put it away."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's an empty packing box over in that
corner," said Dorothy. "Wouldn't it be a good
scheme to put the bundles we shan't have to alter at
all, right into it?"</p>

<p>"Great. Then we shan't have to touch them again
until the time comes to tie them up in fancy paper
to make them look Christmassy."</p>

<p>"Here's the dress Mrs. Lancaster couldn't decide
whether to have made over with black silk or blue
velvet."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lancaster," murmured Ethel Brown, making
out her card.</p>

<p>"That certainly can't go as it is," pronounced
Della.</p>

<p>"There's material enough in it for two children's
dresses," decided Margaret. "Mark it, 'Will make
two dresses.'"</p>

<p>"Here's Maud Delano's jacket. She told Roger
she'd send this over when she got her new one."</p>

<p>"It came this morning. It's all right except for
tightening a button or two," and Ethel Brown inscribed,
"Coat; tighten buttons" on the slip which
Della tied on to one of the incompetent fasteners.</p>

<p>"Good for Mrs. Warburton!" cried Helen.</p>

<p>"What's she done?"</p>

<p>"Here's a great roll of pink flannelette&mdash;and blue,
too&mdash;among her things. We can make dresses and
wrappers and sacques and petticoats out of that."</p>

<p>"It always seems just as warm as woolen stuff to
me," said Dorothy. "Of course it can't be."</p>

<p>"Cotton is never so warm as wool, but if it's warm
enough why ask for anything different. What's in
your mind?" inquired Margaret.</p>

<p>"I was wondering if we couldn't do something to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
forward the cotton crusade at the same time that
we're helping the war orphans."</p>

<p>"You mean by making things out of cotton materials?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The orphans will want the warmest sort
of clothing for winter, I suppose, but spring is coming
after winter and summer after that, and I don't
believe anything we send is going to be wasted."</p>

<p>"They might wear two cotton garments one over
the other," suggested Della.</p>

<p>"I don't say that we'd better make all our clothes
out of cotton material, but where it doesn't make any
especial difference I don't see why we shouldn't
choose cotton stuff. After all, it's the war that has
spoiled the cotton trade so we're still working for war
sufferers only they'll be on this side of the Atlantic.
You know they say the southern cotton planters are
having a serious time of it because they aren't selling
any cotton to speak of in Europe."</p>

<p>"Let's do it!" cried Ethel Blue and she told their
decision to James who had come up to measure the
attic doorway for some reason connected with the
planks they had found.</p>

<p>"It's a great idea. Bully for Dorothy," he cried
working away with a footrule. "This will go all
right," he decided, and ran down again to give a lift
to the other carpenters.</p>

<p>There were eight planks each about six feet long
that Mrs. Smith had discovered in the cellar. A
telephone to Mrs. Warburton had gained her consent
to their use and the boys set about fitting them together
as soon as they were on the top floor. Fortunately
they were already planed and of so good a
length for the purpose they were to be used for that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
nothing was needed but hammer and nails to produce
a set of shelves quite adequate for the purpose. Two
of the boards made the sides, and between them the
remaining six were nailed at intervals.</p>

<p>"We can set it against the wall over here," decided
Tom, "and it won't need a back."</p>

<p>"Which is lucky," James declared, "cos there ain't
no planks to make a back of."</p>

<p>"Let's nail a block of wood or a triangle of wood
under the bottom shelf in the corners," advised
Roger, "so the animal won't wobble."</p>

<p>"If we had enough wood and a saw we could make
nice cubby-holes, one for each bundle," remarked
Tom, his head on one side.</p>

<p>"Tom's getting enthusiastic over carpentering.
We haven't either any more wood or a saw, old man,
so there won't be any cubby-holes this time," decreed
Roger.</p>

<p>"It will do perfectly well this way," said Helen.
"Now if you'll help us up with these bundles&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was a presentable beginning for their collection.
Two parcels in addition to Mrs. Ames's had gone
into the packing case in the corner, but three shelves
of the new set were filled with tight rolls, each with
its tag forward so that no time would be lost in
examining the contents, again.</p>

<p>"That's what I call a good beginning," announced
Helen after the boys had swept up their shavings
and had taken them and their hammers and the remaining
nails down stairs.</p>

<p>"What next, Madam President?" inquired James
when they returned. The girls were already spreading
out the pink and blue flannelette on a plank table<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
that had been left in the attic by the carpenters who
had built the house.</p>

<p>"We are going to cut some little wrappers out of
this material. I think you boys had better fix up
some sort of table over on that side of the room and
get your pasting equipment ready, for we'll need
oodles of boxes of all sizes and you might as well
begin right off to make them."</p>

<p>"Right-o," agreed Roger. "Methinks I saw an
aged table top minus legs leaning against the wall in
the cellar. Couldn't we anchor it on to this wall with
a couple of hinges and then its two legs will be a
good enough prop?"</p>

<p>"If they're both on the same side."</p>

<p>"It seems to me they are."</p>

<p>"Any superfluous hinges around the house, Dorothy?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not."</p>

<p>"Never mind, I'll get a pair when I go after the
pasteboard and the flour for the paste and a bowl for
a pastepot, and a&mdash;no, <i>three</i> brushes for us three boys
to smear the paste with and some coarse cotton cloth
for binders."</p>

<p>"Don't forget the oil of cloves to keep your paste
from turning sour," Dorothy cried after them.</p>

<p>"And mind you boil it thoroughly," said Margaret.</p>

<p>The boys started again towards the cellar when
Roger's eye happened to fall on the cutting operations
of the girls.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" he cried in scorn. "You are time-wasters!
Why don't you cut out several garments
at once and not have to go through all that spreading
out and pinning down process every time? I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
saw a tailor the other day cutting a pile of trousers
two feet high."</p>

<p>"What with, I should like to know?" inquired
Della mystified.</p>

<p>"He did have a knife run by electricity," admitted
Roger, "but there's no
reason why you can't cut
four or five of those
things just as easily as
one."</p>

<p>"We'll go on down
and get the table top,"
said James, and he and
Tom departed.</p>

<p>"Now, then, watch
your Uncle Roger. Is
this tissue paper affair
your pattern? All you
need to do is to fasten
your cloth tightly down
on to your table four
thicknesses instead of
one. Thumb tacks, Dorothy?
Good child! Now
lay your pattern on it&mdash;yes,
thumb-tack it down
if you want to&mdash;and go
ahead. You've got new,
sharp shears. Don't be
in a hurry. There you
are&mdash;and you've saved
yourself the fuss of doing that three times
more."</p>

<p>"Roger really has a lot of sense at times," admitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Ethel Brown, after her brother had leaped
down the attic stairs in pursuit of the boys.</p>

<p>"He is good about helping," added Della.</p>

<p>"What is this garment&mdash;a wrapper?" asked Margaret
as Helen held up the soft flannelette.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 282px;">
<img src="images/p67.jpg" width="282" height="450" alt="Wrapper Completed" title="" />
<span class="caption">Wrapper Completed</span>
</div>
<p>"Yes, it's the simplest ever, and we can adapt one
pattern to children
of all sizes or to
grown people," explained
Helen.</p>

<p>"I never heard
of anything so convenient!"</p>

<p>"First, you measure
the child from
the floor to his neck&mdash;I
measured this
on Dicky. Then
you cut a piece of
material twice that
length. That is, if
the kiddy is thirty
inches from the
floor to the chin you
cut your flannelette
sixty inches long."</p>



<p>"Exactly. Then
cut a lengthwise slit
thirty inches long. Then fold the whole thing in
halves across the width of the cloth and sew up the
sides to within four and a half inches of the top and
you have a wrapper all but the sleeves."</p>

<p>"How do you make those?"</p>

<p>"It takes half a yard for a grown person&mdash;a quarter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of a yard for a youngster. Cut the width in
halves and double it and sew it straight into the
holes you've left at the tops."</p>

<p>"Will that be the right length?"</p>

<p>"You can shorten it if you like or lengthen it by
a band. You finish the slit up the front by putting on
a band of some different color. It looks pretty on
the ends of the sleeves, too. We can use blue on
this pink and pink on the blue."</p>

<p>"It's easy enough, isn't it? I think I'll make myself
one when we get through with the Ship."</p>

<p>"All you need to know is the length from the person's
chin to the floor and you can make it do for
anybody. And all you need to do to make a short
sacque is to know the length from the person's chin
to his waist. I have a notion we'll have some wee
bits left that we can make into cunning little jackets
for babies."</p>

<p>"I don't see why this pattern wouldn't do for an
outdoor coat if you made it of thicker cloth&mdash;eider-down,
for instance."</p>

<p>"It would. Gather the ends of the sleeves about
an inch down so as to make a ruffle, and put frogs or
buttons and loops on the front and there you have
it!"</p>

<p>"Did you bring a petticoat pattern, Margaret?"
asked Ethel Blue.</p>

<p>"Haven't you seen the pictures of European peasant
women and little girls with awfully full skirts?
I believe they'd like them if we just cut two widths
of the same length, hemmed them at the bottom, and
ran a draw-string in the top. We can feather-stitch
the top of the hem if we want to make it look pretty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
or we can cut it a little longer and run one or two
tucks."</p>

<p>"Or we might buttonhole a scallop around the
edge instead of hemming it," suggested Ethel Brown.</p>

<p>"You know I believe in doing one thing well,"
said Dorothy. "How would it do if we Club girls
made just coats and wrappers and sacques from that
pattern of Helen's, and petticoats? We can make
them of all sorts of colors and a variety of materials
and we can trim them differently. We'd be making
some mighty pretty ones before we got through."</p>

<p>"I don't see why not," agreed Margaret thoughtfully.
"Let's do it."</p>

<p>"I brought the Red Cross knitting directions," said
Delia. "I didn't get them till this morning."</p>

<p>"Grandmother will be delighted with those. She's
going to take them to the Old Ladies' Home and
start them all to work there."</p>

<p>"Are you sure they'll knit for the children?"</p>

<p>"She's going to ask them to knit for the children
now, with bright-colored yarns. Afterwards they
can knit for the soldiers, and then they must use dark
blue or grey or khaki color&mdash;not even a stripe that
will make any poor fellow conspicuous."</p>

<p>As they finished reading the instructions they heard
the boys tramping upstairs with their paraphernalia.</p>

<p>"It looks to me, Dorothy," said Tom, "as if you
had us on your hands for most of these club meetings,
to do our work here. Are you sure Mrs. Smith
doesn't mind?"</p>

<p>"Mother is delighted," Dorothy reassured him.
"And she wants you all to come down and have some
chocolate."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FOR A TRAVELLER'S KIT</div>


<div class='cap'>ONCE the Club was started on its work it seemed
as if the days were far too short for them to
accomplish half of what they wanted to do. Mrs.
Morton insisted that her children should have at
least two hours out of doors every day, and that cut
down the afternoons into an absurdly brief working
time. Mrs. Smith had electric lights installed in her
attic and it became the habit of the Mortons and
often of the Hancocks to meet there and cut and sew
and jig-saw and paste for an hour or two every
evening. The Watkinses were active in New York
evidently, for Della sent frequent postcards asking
for directions on one point or another and Tom
exchanged jig-saw news with Roger almost daily.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the war was in every one's mind. The
whole country realized the desirability of trying to
obey President Wilson's request for neutrality in
word, thought, and deed. The subject was forbidden
at school where the teachers never referred to
the colossal struggle that was rending Europe and
the children of varied ancestries played together harmoniously
in the school yard. If at the high school
Fr&auml;ulein and Mademoiselle were looked at with a
new interest by their scholars no word suggestive of
a possible lack of harmony was uttered to them, and
their friendship for each other seemed to increase
with every day's prolongation of the war.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Morton family war discussion was not forbidden
and the events of the last twenty-four hours
as the newspapers reported them were talked over
at dinner every evening. Mrs. Morton thought that
the children should not be ignorant of the most upheaving
event that had stirred the world in centuries,
but she did not permit any violent expressions of
partisanship.</p>

<p>"You children are especially bound to be neutral,"
she insisted, "because your father and Ethel Blue's
father are in the service of our country, and a neutrality
as complete as possible is more desirable from
them and their families than from civilians."</p>

<p>A new idea was blossoming in the young people's
minds, however. They had grown up with the belief
that armament was necessary to preserve peace.
Great men and good had said so. "If we are prepared
for war," they declared, "other nations will be
afraid to fight us." Captain and Lieutenant Morton
had agreed with them, as was natural for men of
their profession. They did not believe in aggression
but in being ready for defense should they be
attacked.</p>

<p>Now it seemed to Roger and Helen as they read
of the sufferings of invaded France and the distress
of trampled Belgium that no country had the right
to benefit by results obtained through such cruel
means.</p>

<p>"Just suppose a shell should drop down here just
as we were walking along," imagined Roger as he
and Helen were on their way to school. "Suppose
Patrick Shea's cornfield there was marched over before
the corn was harvested and all these houses and
churches and schools were blown up or burned down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and all the people of this town were lying around
in the streets dead or wounded!"</p>

<p>"When you bring it home to Rosemont it doesn't
sound the way it does when you read in the histories
about a 'movement' here and a 'turning of the right
flank' there, and 'the end of the line crumpling up.'
When the line crumples up it means fathers and
brothers are killed and women and children starve&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Think what it would be to have nothing to eat
and to have to grub around in the fields and devour
roots like the peasants in the famine time in Louis
XIV's reign."</p>

<p>"And think about the destruction of all the little
homes that have been built up with so much care and
happiness. Mary told me her sister bought a chair
one month and a table at another time when she and
her husband came across bargains," said practical
Ethel Brown who had caught up with them.
"They've furnished their whole house the way we
children have added to our kitchen tins and plates;
and then everything would be broken to smash by
just one of those shells."</p>

<p>"The people who've been spreading the gospel
of peace for years and years needn't be discouraged
now, it seems to me," observed Roger thoughtfully,
"even if it does look as if all their talk had been for
nothing. These horrors make a bigger appeal than
any amount of talk."</p>

<p>"Grandfather Emerson says that perhaps universal
peace is going to be the result of the war. It
seems far off enough now."</p>

<p>"It will be dearly bought peace."</p>

<p>"Hush, there goes Mademoiselle. I wonder when
she's going to sail."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't you ask her to-day? The Club must
give her some kind of send-off, you know."</p>

<p>"I wonder if she'd mind if we went to New York
to see her start?"</p>

<p>"It won't be hard to find out. We can tell her
that we won't be offended if she says 'No.'"</p>

<p>"If she's willing we might take that opportunity
to go over the ship. I've always wanted to go over
an ocean steamer."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they won't let anybody do it now on
account of the war. It will be great if we can,
though."</p>

<p>The Service Club learned more geography in the
course of its studies of the war news than its members
ever had learned before voluntarily. The approach
of the German army upon Paris was watched
every day and its advance was marked upon a large
map that Roger had installed in the sitting-room.
When the Germans withdrew the change of their line
and its daily relation to the battle front of the Allies
was noted by the watchful pencil of one or another
of the newspaper readers.</p>

<p>Thanks to the simplicity of the pattern which the
Club had adopted for its own they were enabled to
make a large number of gay garments in a wonderfully
short time. From several further donations of
material they made wrappers for children of fourteen,
twelve, ten, down to the babies, adding to each
a belt of the same color as the band so that the
garments might serve as dresses at a pinch. They
found that with the smaller sizes they could cut off a
narrow band from the width of the cloth at each
side, and that served as trimming for another garment
of contrasting color.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>When they had constructed a goodly pile of long
wrappers they fell upon the short sacques, and before
many days passed a mound of pink-banded blue and
blue-banded pink, and red-banded white and white-banded
red rose beside their machines. Della wrote
that she was using her mother's machine and was
learning how better and better every day. Thanks
to their lessons at Chautauqua Margaret and Helen
sewed well on the machine already. Ethel Brown
and Ethel Blue and Dorothy basted on the bands
and the belts and added the fastenings. It was their
fingers, too, that feather-stitched and cat-stitched
the petticoats that came into being with another
donation of flannelette. Dorothy was glad when
any new material was cotton as every yard that they
used helped the South to rid itself of its unsold crop.</p>

<p>"Ladies are going to wear cotton dresses all winter,
they say," she told the Club at one of its meetings.
"Mother is going to let me have all my new dresses
made of cotton stuff and she's going to have some
herself."</p>

<p>"We wear cotton middies all winter," protested
the Ethels who felt as if Dorothy felt that they were
not doing their share to help on the cause she was
interested in.</p>

<p>"When Aunt Marion gets your new dancing school
dresses couldn't you ask her to get cotton ones?"</p>

<p>"I suppose we could. Do you think they'd be
pretty enough?"</p>

<p>"Some cotton dresses that are going to be worn
on the opening night of the opera at the Metropolitan
are to be on exhibition in New York in a week or
two."</p>

<p>"If cotton is good enough for that purpose I guess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
it's good enough for your dancing class," laughed
Helen.</p>

<p>"Mother says they make perfectly beautiful cottons
now of exquisite colors and lovely designs.
Don't you think it would be great if we set the
fashion of the dancing class?"</p>

<p>"Let's do it. Mother says silk isn't appropriate
for girls of our age, anyway."</p>

<p>"If you can be dressed appropriately and beautifully
at the same time I don't see that you have anything
to complain of," smiled Helen.</p>

<p>With the short time that the girls had at their
command every day it did not seem as if they would
be able to do much with the garments that came in to
be made over. There were not many of these because
the boys had been instructed after the first day
to ask that alterations and mending be done at home,
but there were a few dresses like Mrs. Lancaster's
that were on their hands. Mrs. Smith came to their
help when this work bade fair to be too much for
them.</p>

<p>"I'll ask Aunt Marion and Mrs. Emerson and
Mrs. Hancock and Mrs. Watkins to lunch with me
some day," she promised Dorothy, "and after
luncheon we'll have an old-fashioned bee and rip up
these dresses and then we can see what material they
give us and we can plan what to do with them."</p>

<p>The scheme worked out to a charm. The elders
enjoyed themselves mightily and the resulting pile
of materials, smoothly ironed and carefully sorted
gave Margaret and Helen a chance to exercise their
ingenuity. Mrs. Watkins took back to town with
her enough stuff for two, promising to help Della
with them, and the suburban girls, with the assistance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of the grown-ups, made six charming frocks that
looked as good as new.</p>

<p>It was early in October that Helen rushed home
from school one day with the news that Mademoiselle
was going to sail at the end
of the week.</p>

<p>"We must begin to-day to
make up a good-bye parcel
for her," she cried.</p>

<p>"Red Cross nurses are
allowed a very small kit,"
warned Mrs. Morton.</p>

<p>"We can try to make
things so tiny that she won't
have to leave them behind
her when she goes on duty,
but even if she does she can
give them to somebody who
can make them useful."</p>

<p>"I'll make steamer slippers
to begin with," said
Ethel Brown.</p>

<p>"How?" asked Ethel
Blue.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 211px;">
<img src="images/p76.jpg" width="211" height="450" alt="Top of Slipper" title="" />
<span class="caption">Top of Slipper<br />Sew a and b together</span>
</div>



<p>"You get a pair of fleecy
inner soles&mdash;they have them
at all the shoe stores&mdash;and
then you cut a top piece of bright colored chintz
just the shape of the top part of a slipper and you
sew it together at the back and bind the edges all
around."</p>

<p>"How do you put the top and the sole together?"</p>

<p>"The edge of the sole is soft enough to sew
through. You turn the top inside out over the sole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and sew the binding of the chintz on to the edge of
the sole over and over and when you turn it right
side out there you are with gay shoes."</p>

<p>"They'll fill up a bag, though," commented Ethel
Blue. "I should think you might make a pair just
like that only make the sole of something that would
double up. Then they'd go into a case and be more
compact."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea, too," agreed Ethel Brown.
"What could you use for a sole?"</p>

<p>"Soft leather would be best. I imagine you could
get a piece from the cobbler down town. Or you
could get the very thin leather that they used at
Chautauqua for cardcases and pocket books&mdash;the
kind Roger uses&mdash;and stitch two pieces together."</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't a heavy duck sole do?" suggested
Mrs. Emerson.</p>

<p>"If you stepped on a pin it wouldn't keep it out as
well as leather," objected her daughter.</p>

<p>"I believe I'll try a pair with a flowery chintz top
and a duck sole covered with chintz like a lining to
the shoe," said Ethel Blue slowly as she thought it
out. "Then I'll make the case of two pieces of
chintz bound together."</p>

<p>"One piece ought to be longer than the other so
that it would be a flap to come over like an
envelope."</p>

<p>This was Ethel Brown's contribution to the slipper
building.</p>

<p>"You could fasten it with a glove snapper. I got
some the other day for my leather work," said Roger.
"I'll put them on for you."</p>

<p>"Why don't you Ethels make both kinds?" suggested
Dorothy. "She'll find a use for them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you girls will make it I'll contribute the silk for
a bath wrap that she can throw over her warm one,
just for looks, on the boat," said Mrs. Emerson.
"I have one I use on sleeping cars and it rolls up into
the smallest space you can imagine."</p>

</div>

<p>"Good for Grandmother!" cried a chorus of
voices.</p>

<p>"Can we use our famous wrapper pattern?" asked
Helen.</p>

<p>"I don't see why not. Mine has a hood but that
isn't a difficult addition if you merely shape the neck
of your kimono a little and then cut a square of the
material, sew it across one end and round the lower
end a trifle to fit into the neck hole you've made."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"How about longer sleeves, Mother?" asked Mrs.
Morton.</p>

<p>"I think I would make them longer. And I'd also
make an envelope bag of the same silk to carry it in
on the return trip from the bath. You'll be surprised
to find into how small an envelope it will go."</p>

<p>"Put a cord from one corner of the envelope to
the other so that Mademoiselle may have her hands
free for her soap and towel and other needfuls,"
advised Mrs. Smith, who had been listening to the
suggestions.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't another envelope arrangement of
chintz lined with rubber cloth make a good washrag
bag or sponge bag?" asked Ethel Brown.</p>

<p>"Nothing better unless you put a rubber-lined
pocket in a Pullman apron."</p>

<p>This hint from Grandmother Emerson aroused the
curiosity of the young people.</p>

<p>"What is a Pullman apron? Tell us about it,"
they cried.</p>

<p>"Mine is made of linen crash," said Mrs. Emerson.
"Dorothy will insist on your making yours of
cotton chintz and it will be just as good and even
prettier. Get a yard. Cut off a piece thirty inches
long and make it fourteen wide. Bind the lower
edge with tape. Turn up six inches across the bottom
and stitch the one big pocket it makes into
smaller ones of different sizes by rows of up and
down stitching. Make a bag of rubber cloth just the
right size to fit one of the larger pockets. Take the
six inches that you cut off from your yard of material
and bind it on both edges with tape. Stitch that
across your apron about four inches above the top of
the lower row of pockets. Divide the strip into as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
many pockets as you want to for hairpins and pins
and neck arrangements, and so on."</p>

<p>"Your apron has two raw edges now," said Helen.</p>

<p>"Bind it on each side with tape. That will finish
it and it will also fasten the edges of the pockets
securely to the apron. Sew across the top a tape long
enough to serve as strings."</p>

<p>"The idea is to roll all your toilet belongings up
together in your bag, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and when you go to the ladies' room on the
train you tie the apron around your waist and then
you have your brush and comb and hairpins and tooth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
brush and washrag all where you can lay your fingers
on them in a second of time."</p>

<p>"I got my best tortoise-shell hairpin mixed up with
another woman's once, and I never recovered it,"
said Mrs. Morton meditatively.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't have happened if you'd been supplied
with a bag like this," said her mother.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle's silk wrap must be grey to match
her other Red Cross equipment," said Mrs. Emerson,
"but I don't see why the chintz things shouldn't
be as gay as you like."</p>

<p>"Pink roses would be most becoming to her style
of beauty," murmured Roger who had come in.</p>

<p>"I don't know but pink roses would be becoming
enough for slippers," agreed Ethel Blue so seriously
that every one laughed.</p>

<p>"Let's get pink flowered chintz," said Ethel
Brown. "You make the soft kind and I'll make the
stiff kind and Dorothy'll make the apron and Helen
will make the kimono. Who's got any more ideas?"</p>

<p>"I have," contributed Roger. "I'll make a case
for her manicure set. I haven't got time this week
unfortunately to tool the leather but I'll make a plain
one that will be useful if it isn't as pretty as I can do."</p>

<p>"What shape will it be?"</p>

<p>"I got part of my idea from Grandfather Emerson's
spectacle case that I was examining the other
day. Ethel Blue's case for the soft slippers is going
to be something like it."</p>

<p>"Two pieces of leather rounded at the lower corners
and stitched together at the sides and with a
flap to shut in the contents?" guessed Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Correct. I shall make the case about four inches
long when it's closed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"That means that you'd have one strip four inches
long and the other, the one with the flap, six inches
long."</p>

<p>"Once more correct, most noble child. It will be
a liberal two inches wide, a bit more in this instance
because I'm not much of a sewer and I want to be
sure that I'm far enough from the edge to make it
secure."</p>

<p>"You don't try to turn it inside out, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am. Not that mite of an object. You
fit a tiny pasteboard slide into the case. Cover it
with velvet or leather or a scrap of Ethel Blue's
chintz&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Rah for cotton," cheered Dorothy.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and on one side of this division you slip in the
scissors and the file and the tweezers or the orange
stick and on the other a little buffer with a strap
handle that doesn't take up any room."</p>

<p>"How in the world do you happen to be so up
in manicure articles?" queried Helen, amazed at his
knowledge.</p>

<p>"Nothing strange about that," returned Roger.
"Aunt Louise showed me hers the other day when I
was talking to her about making one for just this
occasion. Aha!"</p>

<p>"You could make the same sort of case without
the pasteboard partition, for a tiny sewing kit," offered
Ethel Blue, "and one of the envelope shape will
hold soap leaves."</p>

<p>"I'd like to suggest a couple of shirtwaist cases,"
said Mrs. Smith. "They are made of dotted Swiss
muslin that takes up next to no room and washes like
a handkerchief. You'd better make Mademoiselle's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of colored muslin or of colored batiste for she won't
want to be bothered with thinking about laundry any
oftener than she has to."</p>

<p>"What shape are the bags?"</p>

the bottom. Take a piece of muslin twice the size
and lay it flat. Fold over
the edges till they meet in
the centre. Then stitch
the tops across, on the inside,
of course, and hem
the slit, and turn them
right side out and that's
all there is to it. They
keep waists or neckwear
apart from the other
clothing in one's bag and
fresher for the separation."</p>



<p>"Since I have my hand
in with knitting," said
Grandmother, "I believe
I'll contribute a pair of
bed-shoes. They're so simple
that any one who can knit a plain strip can do
them."</p>

<p>"Let's have the receipt."</p>

<p>"Cast on stitches enough to run the length of the
person's foot. Fifty will be plenty for any woman
and more than enough for Mademoiselle's tiny foot.
It's well to have the shoe large, though. Knit ahead
until you have a strip six inches high. Then cast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
off from one end stitches enough to make four inches
and go ahead with the remainder for four inches
more."</p>

<p>"That sounds funny to me," observed Ethel
Brown. "Not exactly the shape of my dainty pedestal."</p>

<p>"You'll have made a square with a square out of
one corner like this piece of paper. Now fold it
along the diagonal line from the tip of the small
square to the farthest edge of the big square and sew
up all the edges except those of the small square.
That leaves a hole where you put your foot in.
Crochet an edge there to run a ribbon in&mdash;and you're
done."</p>

<p>"I'm going to run the risk of Mademoiselle's
laughing at me and give her a folding umbrella," said
Mrs. Morton. "It will fit into her bag and at least
she can use it until she goes to the front."</p>

<p>"All this sounds to me like a good outfit for any
woman who is going to travel," observed Helen.
"I'm almost moved to sail myself!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE RED CROSS NURSE SETS SAIL</div>


<div class='cap'>THE girls' cheeks were rosy and their hair was
tangled by the wind as Helen and the rest of
the U. S. C. left the car at West Street and made
their way to the French Line Pier. Roger was heading
the flock of Mortons, Mrs. Smith was with
Dorothy, the Hancocks had come from Glen Point,
more for the fun of seeing a sailing than to say
"Good-bye" to Mademoiselle, whom they hardly;
knew. The Watkinses were accompanied by their
elder brother, Edward, a young doctor.</div>

<p>There was a mighty chattering as the party hastened
down the pier. A mightier greeted them
when they reached the gang plank.</p>

<p>"Every Frenchman left in New York must be here
saying 'Good-bye' to somebody!" laughed Tom as his
eye fell on the throng pressing on to the boat over a
narrow plank across which passengers who had already
said their farewells were leaving, and stewards
were carrying cabin trunks.</p>

<p>"Only one <i>passerelle</i> for all that!" exclaimed a
plump Frenchman whose age might be guessed by the
fashion of his moustache and goatee which declared
him to be a follower of Napoleon III. He was
carrying a bouquet in one hand and kissing the other
vehemently to the lady on the deck who was to be
made the recipient of the flowers as soon as her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
admirer could manage to squeeze himself down the
over-crowded gang plank.</p>

<p>Taxis driving up behind the U. S. C. young people
discharged their occupants upon the agitated scene.
All sorts of messages were being sent across to
friends on the other side, many of them shouted from
pier to deck with a volubility that was startling to
inexperienced French students.</p>

<p>It was quite twenty minutes before the Club succeeded
in filing Indian fashion across the <i>passerelle</i>.
They were met almost at once by Mademoiselle, for
she had been watching their experiences from the
vessel.</p>

<p>"Before you say 'Good-bye' to me," she said hurriedly,
"I want you to go over the ship. I have
special permission from the Captain. You must go
quickly. There are not many minutes, you were so
long in coming on."</p>

<p>She gave them over to the kind offices of a
"<i>mousse</i>" or general utility boy, who in turn introduced
them to a junior officer who examined their permit
as "friends of Mademoiselle Millerand" and
then conveyed them to strange corners whose existence
they never had guessed.</p>

<p>First they peeked into a cabin which was one of
the handsomest on the ship but whose small size
brought from Ethel Brown the comment that it was
a "stingy" little room. The reading and writing
rooms she approved, however, as being cheerful
enough to make you forget you were seasick. A
lingering odor of the food of yester-year seemed to
cling about the saloon and to mingle with a whiff of
oil from the engine room that had assailed them just
before they entered. People were saying farewells<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
here with extraordinary impetuosity, men embracing
each other with a fervor that made the less demonstrative
Americans smile. One group was looking
over a pile of letters on the table to see if absent
friends had sent some message to catch them before
they steamed.</p>

<p>Below were other staterooms, rows upon rows of
them, and yet others below those. By comparison
with the fragrances here that in the saloon seemed a
breeze from Araby the Blest.</p>

<p>From above the party had looked down on the
engines whose huge steel arms slid almost imperceptibly
over each other as if they were slowly, slowly
preparing to spring at an unseen foe; as if they knew
that great waves would try to still them, the mighty
workers of the great ship. A gentle breathing now
seemed to stir them, but far, far down below the
waterline the stokers were feeding the animal with
the fuel that was to give him energy to contend with
storms and winds and come out victor. Half naked
men, their backs gleaming in the light from the
furnaces, threw coal into the yawning mouth. The
heat was intense, and the Ethels turned so pale that
young Doctor Watkins hurried them into the open
air. Helen was not sorry to breathe the coolness
of the Hudson again and even the boys drew a long
breath of relief, though they did not admit that they
had been uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Millerand awaits you in the tea
room," explained the young officer, and he conducted
them to a portion of the deck where passengers could
sit in the open, or, on cold or windy days, behind
glass and watch the sea and the passengers pacing by.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle greeted them with shining eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
During their absence there had been some farewells
that had been difficult.</p>

<p>"You have seen everything?" she inquired pleasantly.
"Then you must have some lemonade with
me before you go," and she gave an order that soon
brought a trayful of glasses that tinkled cheerfully.</p>

<p>"We are not going to be sentimental," she insisted.
"This is just 'Good-bye,' and thank you many times
for being so good to me at school, and many, many
times more for the bundle that is in my room to surprise
me. I shall open it when the Statue of Liberty
is out of sight, when I can no more see my adopted
land. Then shall I think of all of you and of your
Club for Service."</p>

<p>"Where do you expect to be sent, Mademoiselle?"
inquired Doctor Watkins as the party walked toward
the <i>passerelle</i> over which they must somehow contrive
to make their way before they could touch foot
upon the pier.</p>

<p>"To Belgium, I think. My brother is a surgeon
and I have a distant relative in the ministry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;<i>the</i> Millerand?"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>"So probably I shall be sent wherever I wish&mdash;and
my heart goes but to Belgium. It is natural."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is natural. May you have luck," he cried
holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle is going to Belgium," he told the
young people who were awaiting their turn at the
gang-plank.</p>

<p>They gazed at her with a sort of awe. Tales of
war's horrors were common in the ears of all of them,
and it was difficult to believe that the slight figure
standing there so quietly beside them would see with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
her own eyes the uptorn fields and downfallen cottages,
the dying men and the miserable women and
children they had seen only in imagination.</p>

<p>"Oh," gasped Ethel Blue; "oh! <i>Belgium!</i> Oh,
Mademoiselle, <i>won't</i> you send us back a Belgian
baby? The Club would <i>love</i> to take care of it!
Wouldn't we? Wouldn't we?" she cried turning
from one to another with glittering eyes.</p>

<p>"We would, Mademoiselle, we would," cried every
one of them; and as the big ship was warped out of
the pier they waved their handkerchiefs and their
hands and cried over and over, "Send us a Belgian
baby!"</p>

<p>"<i>Un b&eacute;b&eacute; belge! Ces chers enfants!</i>" ejaculated
a motherly Frenchwoman who was weeping near
them. "A Belgian baby! These dear children."</p>

<p>And then, to James's horror, she kissed him, first
on one cheek and then on the other.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PLANNING THE U. S. C. "SHOW"</div>


<div class='cap'>IT was becoming more and more evident every day
to the president of the United Service Club that
it must have more money than was at its disposal at
the moment or it would not be able to carry out its
plans. Already it owed to Mrs. Morton a sum that
Helen knew was larger than her mother could lend
them conveniently. All of Grandfather Emerson's
donation had gone to provide knitting needles and
yarn for the occupants of the Old Ladies' Home, and
the Club's decision to lay itself under no financial
obligation to people outside of the immediate families
of the members had obliged her to refuse a few small
gifts that had been offered.</div>

<p>All the members of the Club were working hard
to earn money beyond their allowances and every cent
was going into the Club's exchequer. Roger was
faithful in his attention to the three furnaces he had
undertaken to care for, though he was not above a
feeling of relief that the weather was continuing so
mild that he had not yet had to keep up fires continuously
in any of them. James still drove his
father, though the doctor threatened him with discharge
almost every day because of his habit of
cutting corners. The girls were carrying out their
plans for money-making, and Della had secured
another order for stenciled curtains which Dorothy
and Ethel Brown filled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>What with school and working for the orphans
and working for the Club treasury these were busy
days, and Helen felt that something must be done at
once to provide a comparatively large sum so that
their indebtedness might be paid off and the pressure
upon each one of them would not be so heavy.</p>

<p>Helen and James were going over the Club accounts
one Saturday before the regular meeting. A
frown showed Helen's anxiety and James's square
face looked squarer and more serious than ever as he
saw the deficit piled against them.</p>

<p>"It's high time we gave that entertainment we
talked about so much when we began this thing," he
growled. "People will have forgotten all about it
and we'll have to advertise it all over again."</p>

<p>"That'll be easy enough if we make use of some
of the small children in some way. All their relatives
near and far will know all about it promptly
and they'll all come to see how the kiddies perform,"
said Helen wisely, though her look of perplexity continued.</p>

<p>"Let's bring it up at the meeting right now. I
don't believe we can do anything better this afternoon
than plan out our show and decide who and what
and where."</p>

<p>"'Where' is answered easily enough&mdash;the hall of
the schoolhouse. 'Who' and 'what' require more
thought."</p>

<p>It turned out, however, that every one had been
thinking of stunts to do himself or for some one else
to do, so that the program did not take as much time
as if the subject had not been lying in their minds for
several weeks.</p>

<p>"At the beginning," said Ethel Blue, "I think some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
one ought to get up and tell what the Club is trying
to do&mdash;all about the war orphans and the Santa Claus
Ship."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't Grandfather Emerson be a good one
to do that?"</p>

<p>"I don't think we want to have any grown people
in our show," was Helen's opinion. "If we bring
them in then the outside people will expect more from
us because they'll think that we've been helped and
it won't be fair to us or to our grown-ups."</p>

<p>"That's so," agreed Tom from the depths of a
lifetime of experience of the ways of people in church
entertainments. "Let's do every single thing ourselves
if we can, and I believe the audience will like
it better even if it isn't all as O. K. as it would be if
we had a grown-up or two to help pull the oars."</p>

<p>"The first question before us, then, is who will do
this explanation act that Ethel Blue suggests?"</p>

<p>There was a dead silence. No one wanted to offer.
There seemed no one person on whom the task fell
naturally unless&mdash;"The Club was Ethel Blue's idea,"
went on Helen. "Isn't she the right one to explain
it?" and "The president of the Club ought to tell
about it," said Ethel Blue. Both girls spoke at once.</p>

<p>There was unanimous laughter.</p>

<p>"'Ayther is correct,'" quoted Roger. "I think
Helen is the proper victim."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," Ethel Blue supported him so earnestly
that every one laughed again.</p>

<p>"You see, no one knows about its being Ethel
Blue's idea and that would take a lot more explaining
or else it would seem that there was no good
reason for the president's not acting as showman and
introducing her freaks to the audience."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Speak for yourself, John!' I'm no freak!"
declared James. "I think Helen's the right one to
make the introduction, though."</p>

<p>Helen shivered.</p>

<p>"I must say I hate to do it," she said, "but we all
agreed when we went into this that we'd do what
came up, no matter whether we liked it or not, so
here goes Number 1 on the program," and she wrote
on her pad, beneath an elaborate</p>

<div class='center'>
PROGRAM<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>which she had been drawing and decorating as she
talked.</div>

<p>1. Explanatory address. Helen Morton.</p>

<p>"Now, then," queried Ethel Brown, "what next?"</p>

<p>"Music, if there's any one to tootle for the
ladies," said Roger.</p>

<p>"Dorothy's the singer."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't sing all alone," objected Dorothy
shrinkingly. "But Mother said she'd drill a chorus
of children and I wouldn't mind doing the solo part
with a lot of others on the stage with me."</p>

<p>"How about a chorus in costume?" asked Helen.</p>

<p>"What kind of costume?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know&mdash;something historical, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Why not the peasant costumes of the countries
in the war?" suggested Ethel Blue. "We're working
for the children and we'll have a child or two
from each country."</p>

<p>"A sort of illustration of Helen's speech," said
Tom.</p>

<p>"They might sing either the national songs of their
countries or children's songs," said Dorothy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Or both, with you dressed as Columbia and singing
the Star Spangled Banner at the end."</p>

<p>"La, la! Fine!" commended Margaret. "Put
down Number 2, Helen, 'Songs by War Orphans.'
We can work out the details later, or leave them to
Dorothy and her mother."</p>

<p>"I've been thinking that we might as well utilize
some of the folk dances that we learned at Chautauqua
last summer," said Ethel Brown. "Wouldn't
Number 3 be a good spot to put in the Butterfly
Dance?"</p>

<p>"That was one of the prettiest dances at the
Exhibition," said James. "Let's have it."</p>

<p>"Margaret and I are too tall for it, but you four
young ones know it and you can teach four more girls
easily enough."</p>

<p>"We'll ask them to-morrow at school," said Dorothy,
"and we'll have a rehearsal right off. Mother
will play for us and it won't take any time at
all."</p>

<p>"The costumes won't take any time, either. Any
white dress will do and the wings are made by strips
of soft stuff&mdash;cheese cloth or something even softer,
pale blue and pink and green and yellow. They're
fastened at the shoulders and a loop goes over the
wrist or the little finger so the arms can keep them
waving."</p>

<p>"Do you remember the steps, Dorothy?"</p>

<p>"They're very simple, but almost anything that
moves sort of swimmingly will do."</p>

<p>"There's Number 3, then," decided Dorothy.
"Now the boys ought to appear."</p>

<p>"Yes, what have you three been planning to throw
us in the shade?" inquired Della.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've got a fancy club-swinging act that's rather
good," admitted Roger modestly.</p>

<p>"You have?" asked Tom in surprise. "So have
I. What's yours?"</p>

<p>"Come over here and I'll tell you," and the two
boys retired to a corner where they conferred. It
was evident, from their burst of laughter and their
exclamations that they highly approved of each
other's schemes.</p>

<p>"We've decided that we won't tell you what our
act is," they declared when they came back to the
broken meeting. "We'll surprise you as well as the
rest of the audience."</p>

<p>"Meanies," pronounced Ethel Brown. "Helen,
put down 'Number 4, Club Swinging by Two
Geese!'"</p>

<p>"Not geese," corrected Tom, with a glance at
Roger, who made a sign of caution.</p>

<p>"What next?" queried the president.</p>

<p>"Let's have some of the small children now. Our
honorary member ought to be on the card," said
Della.</p>

<p>"Are you sure he wouldn't be afraid?" asked Tom
of Dicky's brethren.</p>

<p>"Not Dicky," they shrieked in concert.</p>

<p>"I saw a pretty stunt in town the other evening.
It was done by grown people but it would be dear
with little kids," urged Della, her round face beaming
with the joy of her adaptation of the idea. "It
was a new kind of shadow dance."</p>

<p>"Pshaw, that's old," declared Tom with brotherly
curtness.</p>

<p>"It wasn't done behind a sheet. That's the old
way&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"A mighty good way, too," supported James
stoutly. "I've seen some splendid pantomimes done
on a sheet&mdash;'Red Riding Hood' and 'Jack the Giant
Killer,' and a lot more."</p>

<p>"This is much cunninger," insisted Della. "Instead
of a sheet there's a dull, light blue curtain hung
across the stage. The light is behind it, but the actors
are in front of it."</p>

<p>"Then you don't see their shadows."</p>

<p>"You see themselves in silhouette against the blue.
There is a net curtain down between them and the
audience and it looks like moonlight with elves and
fairies playing in it."</p>

<p>"It would be hard to train Dicky to be a fairy,"
decided Ethel Blue so gravely that all the others
laughed.</p>

<p>"I was thinking that it would be fun to have Dicky
and some other children dressed like pussy cats and
rabbits and dogs, and playing about as if they were
frisking in the moonlight."</p>

<p>"Why not have them do a regular little play like
'Flossy Fisher's Funnies' that have been coming out
in the <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>?" screamed Ethel
Brown, electrified at the growth of the idea. "Take
almost any one of them and get the children to play
the little story it tells and I don't see why it wouldn't
be too cunning for words."</p>

<p>"What kind of stories?" asked James who liked
to understand.</p>

<p>"I don't remember any one exactly but they are
something like this;&mdash;Mr. Dog goes fishing on the
bank of the stream. A strip of pasteboard cut at
the top into rushes will give the effect of a brook, you
know. He pulls up a fish with a jerk that throws<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
it over his head. Pussy Cat is waiting just behind
him. She seizes the fish and runs away with it.
Mr. Dog runs after her. The cat jumps over a
wheelbarrow, but the dog doesn't see it and gets a
fall&mdash;and so on."</p>

<p>"I can see how it would be funny with little scraps
of kids," pronounced Tom. "Who'll train them?"</p>

<p>"I'll do that," offered Ethel Brown. "Dicky's
always good with me and if he understands the story
he'll really help teach the others."</p>

<p>"Pick out a simple 'Flossy Fisher' or make up an
easy story with plenty of action," advised Margaret.
"The chief trouble you'll have is to make the children
stay apart on the stage. They'll keep bunching
up and spoiling the silhouettes if you aren't careful."</p>

<p>"Number 5. Silhouettes," wrote Helen on her
pad. "What's Number 6?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you'll approve of this,"
offered Dorothy rather shyly, "but when I was at
the Old Ladies' Home the other day I thought they
made a real picture knitting away there in the sunshine
in their sitting room. Do you think some of
them could be induced to come to the schoolhouse
and make a tableau?"</p>

<p>"Fine!" commended Helen.</p>

<p>"You could have it a picture of sentiment, such as
Dorothy had in mind, I judge," said Tom, "or you
could turn it into a comic by having some one sing
'Sister Susie's Sewing Shirts for Soldiers.'"</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"A stay-at-home war song they're singing in England.
It's funny because it's so full of S's that it's
almost impossible to sing it without a mistake. I
think it would be better, though, to have the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
ladies just knitting away. After all, it's sympathy
with the orphans we want to arouse."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we have a tableau within a tableau&mdash;a
picture at the back placed with the figures posed behind
a net curtain so that they'd be dimmed&mdash;a picture
of some of the Belgian orphans refugeeing into
Holland or something of that sort?"</p>

<p>"If Mademoiselle would only send us right off
that Belgian baby that James got kissed for we'd
have an actual exhibit," said Roger.</p>

<p>James made a face at the memory of the unexpected
caress he had earned unwittingly, but he approved
highly of the addition to the picture of the
old ladies.</p>

<p>"They're thinking about the orphans as they knit&mdash;and
there are the orphans," he said, and even his
sister Margaret smiled at the approbation with which
he looked on a tableau that left nothing to the imagination.</p>

<p>"Number 6 is settled, then. Why can't we have
the minuet for Number 7?"</p>

<p>"Good. All of us here know it so we shan't need
to rehearse much."</p>

<p>"On that small stage four couples will be plenty,
I say," offered Roger.</p>

<p>"I think so, too. Eight would make it altogether
too crowded," declared Helen. "That means
that four of us girls will dance&mdash;we can decide which
ones later&mdash;and you three boys, and we'll only have
to train one new boy."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with George Foster? His
sister is a dancing teacher and perhaps he knows it
already."</p>

<p>"He's the best choice we can make. We want to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
get this thing done just as fast as we can for several
reasons," continued Helen. "In the first place any
entertainment goes off more snappily if the fun of
doing it isn't all worn off by too many rehearsals."</p>

<p>"Correct," agreed Tom. "Remember that Children's
Symphony we exhausted ourselves on for a
month last winter, Della?"</p>

<p>Della did and expressed her memories with closed
eyes and out-stretched hands.</p>

<p>"If each one of us makes himself and herself responsible
for having his own part perfect and the
stunts that he's drilling others in as nearly perfect as
he can, then I don't see why we need more than ten
days for it."</p>

<p>"Especially as we know all the dances now and the
Old Ladies' Home tableau won't take much preparation."</p>

<p>"Have we got enough numbers on the program,
Helen?"</p>

<p>"I think we ought to end with a long thing of some
sort."</p>

<p>"We'll never pull off the show if you try to stick
in a play," growled James.</p>

<p>"Not a play, but I was reading Browning's 'Pied
Piper of Hamelin' the other day and it can easily be
made workable with just a little speaking and some
pantomime. Two or three rehearsals ought to do
it."</p>

<p>"All right, then. Your sufferings be on your
head."</p>

<p>"You'll all back me up, won't you?"</p>

<p>"We'll do whatever you tell us, if that's what you
want."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Read us the whole program, Madam President,"
begged Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Here you are; I've changed the order a little:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE EVENTFUL EVENING</div>


<div class='cap'>IF the U. S. C.'s had thought themselves busy
before they undertook their entertainment they
concluded as they rushed from one duty to another
in the ten days of preparation for that function that
they had not learned the A B C of busy-ness. Mrs.
Morton always insisted that, whatever was on foot,
school work must not be slighted.</div>

<p>"Your education is your preparation for life," she
said. "While you are young you must lay down a
good foundation for the later years to build on.
You know what happens when a foundation is poor."</p>

<p>They did. A building in Rosemont had fallen
into a heap of ruins not long before, to the shame
of the contractor who had put in poor work.</p>

<p>So all the school duties were attended to faithfully,
and the out-of-door time was not skimped though
the out-of-door time was largely devoted to doing
errands connected with the "show," and the home
lessons were learned as thoroughly as usual. But
sewing went by the board for ten days except such
sewing as was necessary for the making of costumes.</p>

<p>"Here's a chance for your Club to try out some
of Roger's ideas of system," said Grandfather Emerson
as he listened to the plans which were always
on the lips of the club members whenever he met
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think we're doing it all pretty systematically,"
Helen defended. "Each one of us is responsible
for doing certain things and our work doesn't overlap.
When we come together for a general rehearsal
I believe we're going to find that all the parts
will fit together like a cut-out puzzle."</p>

<span class="caption">Costume for Butterfly Dance</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Emerson said that he hoped so in a tone of
such doubt that Helen was more than ever determined
that all should run smoothly. To that end
she made a diplomatic investigation into every number
of the program. Every one she found to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
going on well. Her own address was already
blocked out in her mind. Dorothy had taken bodily
a singing class that Mrs. Smith had started at the
Rosemont Settlement and, with the knowledge of
singing that the children already had, they soon were
drilled in their special songs and in the motions that
enlivened them. Mrs. Smith and Dorothy were
also preparing the costumes and they reported that
the mothers of the children were helping, some of
them providing actual peasant costumes that had
come from the old country.</p>

<p>With four girls who already knew the butterfly
dance the drilling of another quartette was swiftly
done, and the Ethels were willing to put their flock
of butterflies on the stage four days after they had
begun to practice. Because every one of them had
a white dress their costumes required almost no
work beyond the cutting lengthwise of a yard and a
quarter of cheesecloth. When they had gathered
one end and attached the safety pin which was to fasten
it to the shoulder, and gathered the other end
and sewed on a loop which was to go over the little
finger&mdash;all of which took about five minutes&mdash;that
costume was finished.</p>

<p>About the boys' club swinging Helen could not
obtain any information beyond the assurance that all
was well. With that she had to content herself.</p>

<p>The old ladies at the Home were delighted to be
able to help and also delighted at the excitement of
taking part in the entertainment. They voted for
the trio who should represent them in the tableaux
and generously selected three who were the most
handicapped of all of them. One was lame and always
sat with her crutch beside her; one was blind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
though her fast flying fingers did not betray it; and
the third lived in a wheel-chair. They demurred
strongly to their companions' choice, but the other
old ladies were insistent and the appointees could
not resist the fun. Mr. Emerson agreed to provide
transportation for them, wheel-chair and all, and
Doctor Hancock was to send over a wagonette from
Glen Point so that the rest of the inmates of the
Home might take advantage of the tickets that some
mysterious giver had sent to every one of them.
For the inner picture Dicky and two of his kindergarten
friends were to be posed, clad in rags.</p>

<p>"It's no trouble to provide Dicky with a ragged
suit," said Mrs. Morton. "The difficulty is going
to be to make him look serious and poorly fed."</p>

<p>"A little artistic shading under his eyes and on
his cheeks will make his plumpness disappear. I'll
'make up' the children," offered Mrs. Emerson.</p>

<p>Most difficult of all were the silhouettes. This
was because the children who were to take part were
so tiny that they could not quite remember the sequence
of the story they were to act out. There
were moments when the Ethels were almost disposed
to give up the youngsters and try the shadows with
larger children.</p>

<p>"The little ones make so much cunninger cats and
dogs than the bigger children I don't want to do it
unless we have to," said Ethel Brown, and they
found at last that perseverance won the day. Here,
too, the children's mothers helped with the costumes,
and turned out a creditable collection of animal coverings,
not one of them with a bit of fur.</p>

<p>"They're another help to your cotton crusade,"
Ethel Blue told Dorothy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Grey flannelette made a soft maltese pussy; the
same material in brown covered a dog; a white coat
splashed with brown spots out of the family coffee
pot was the covering of another Fido, while another
white garment stained with black and yellow ornamented
a tortoise-shell cat. The rabbits all wore
white.</p>

<p>As with the butterfly dance so many of the performers
knew the minuet that it needed only two rehearsals.
The new boy worked in without any
trouble and was so graceful and dignified that the
U. S. C. boys found themselves emulating his excellent
manner.</p>

<p>Helen herself took charge of "The Pied Piper"
and so few were the speaking parts and so short and
so natural the pantomime that she drilled her company
in three rehearsals, though she herself worked
longer in private over the manipulation of certain
stage "properties," and had one or two special sessions
with Dr. Edward Watkins who was to take
the principal part.</p>

<p>Friday evening was chosen for the performance.
The Rosemont young people usually had their evening
festivities on Fridays because they could sit up
later than usual without being disturbed about school
work the next morning. The special Friday proved
to be clear with a brilliant moon and the old ladies
driving over from the Home felt themselves to be
out on a grand lark. Evidently the boys had done
their publicity work thoroughly, for not only did
they see a goodly number of Rosemont people approaching
the schoolhouse, but, just as they drove up
to the door, a special car from Glen Point stopped
to let off a crowd of friends of the Hancocks who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
had come over to see "what the children were doing
for the war orphans."</p>

<p>The school hall held 300 people and no seats were
reserved except those for the old ladies. They
found themselves in front where they could see well
and where they were near enough to appreciate the
care with which the edge of the platform was
decorated. That had been Margaret Hancock's
work and she had remembered the success of the
Service Club in preparing the platform for the Old
First Night exercises at Chautauqua.</p>

<p>Tom had insisted that the Club should go to the
extra expense of having tickets printed. James had
objected.</p>

<p>"This old treasury of ours is almost an empty
box," he growled. "We can't afford to spend cold
cash on printing."</p>

<p>"It will pay in the end, believe me," insisted Tom
slangily. "You know there are always a lot of
people who think they'll go to a show and then at
the last minute think they won't if something more
amusing turns up. If you sell tickets beforehand
you've got their contribution to the cause even if
they don't appear themselves."</p>

<p>"Tom's right," agreed Margaret. "They won't
mind losing so small a sum as a quarter if they
don't go."</p>

<p>"And they'd think it was too small an amount to
bother themselves about by hunting up the treasurer
and paying it in if they didn't have a ticket," said
Roger.</p>

<p>"And there are some people who'd be sure to
come and swell the audience just because they had
spent a quarter on a ticket," said Ethel Brown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"What does the president think?" asked Ethel
Blue.</p>

<p>Helen agreed with Tom and the tickets were
printed. After all they came to only a small sum
and Roger, peeking through a hole in the curtain,
saw with satisfaction that if there were going to be
any vacant seats at all they would not be many.
When one of the old ladies turned about just before
the curtain went up she saw a solid room behind her
and people standing against the wall.</p>

<p>There was music before the curtain rose. This
enrichment of the program was a surprise to the
performers themselves. Young Doctor Edward
Watkins had become so interested in the United
Service Club when he met them at the French Line
Pier that he had insisted on helping with their work
for the orphans.</p>

<p>"If Mademoiselle really sends you that Belgian
baby you may need a special physician for it," he
said. "So you'd better stand in with one whose
practice isn't big enough yet to take all his time."</p>

<p>He said this to Helen when he appeared with
Tom and Della on the evening of the performance
and announced that not only did he know his part
in the "Piper" but he had brought his violin and
would be glad to be a part of the orchestra.</p>

<p>"But we haven't an orchestra," objected Helen.
"I wish we had."</p>

<p>"Who's going to play for the dances?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Louise."</p>

<p>"Why can't she and I do something at the beginning?
It will seem a little less cold than just having
the curtain go up without any preliminaries."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith proved to be delighted to go over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
with Doctor Watkins the music he had brought and
they selected one or two lively bits that would set
the mood of the audience for the evening. So Mrs.
Morton and the Emersons and the younger members
of the cast were greatly surprised to hear an
overture from a well-played violin accompanied by
the piano. While the applause was dying away the
curtain rose on Helen seated at a desk reading from
a blank exercise book filled with Ethel Blue's neat
writing.</p>

<p>"This is the report of the Secretary of the United
Service Club," began Helen when the applause that
greeted her appearance had subsided. She was
looking very pretty, wearing a straight, plain pink
frock and having her hair bound with a narrow pink
fillet.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't know what the United Service
Club is," she went on, and then she told in the simplest
manner of the beginning of the Club at Chautauqua
the summer before.</p>

<p>"What we're trying to do is to help other people
whether we want to or not," she declared earnestly.</p>

<p>A soft laugh went over the audience at this contradictory
statement.</p>

<p>"I mean," continued Helen, somewhat confused,
"that we mean to do things that will help people
even if we don't get any fun out of it ourselves.
We want to improve our characters, you see," she
added artlessly. "So far we haven't had much
chance to improve our characters because all the
things that have come our way to do have been
things that were great fun&mdash;like to-night.</p>

<p>"To-night," she went on earnestly, "you have
come here to see a little entertainment that we've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
gotten up to make some money so that we could send
a bigger bundle to the Christmas Ship that is going
to sail for Europe early in November. We thought
we could make a good many presents for the war
orphans but we found that our allowances didn't
go as far as we thought they would, although we
have a very careful treasurer," she added with a
smiling glance at the wings of the stage where James
greeted her compliment with a wry face.</p>

<p>"We made a rule that we would make all the
money we needed and not accept presents, so this
show is the result, and we hope you'll like it. Anyway,
we've had lots of fun getting it up."</p>

<p>She bowed her thanks to the applause that greeted
her girlish explanation and stepped behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Immediately a gay march sounded from the piano.
It was a medley of well-known national songs and
in time with its notes a group of children led by
Dorothy ran upon the stage. Dorothy stepped to
the front and sang a few lines of introduction to the
tune of "Yankee Doodle."</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Here we are from Fatherland,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">From Russia and from France,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">From Japan and from Ireland</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We all together dance.</span><br />
<br />
"At home they are not dancing now;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">There's war and awful slaughter;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We here in Rosemont make our bow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Each one Columbia's daughter."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then a flaxen-haired little girl stepped forward
and sang a German folk song and after it she and
two other children dressed in German peasant costume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
danced a merry folk dance. Representatives
of the other countries which Dorothy's verses had
named sang in turn. Then each group sang its national
song, at the end uniting in "The Star Spangled
Banner," in which the standing audience joined.</p>

<p>There was a great clapping when the curtain fell,
but the managers had decided that there should be
no encores, so the curtain merely rose once upon a
bowing, smiling group and then fell with a decision
that was understood to be final.</p>

<p>"Whatever we do wrong, the thing we must do
right," Helen had insisted when she was drilling her
performers, "is to have promptness in putting on
our 'acts.'"</p>

<p>"That's so," agreed Tom, "there's nothing an audience
hates more than to wait everlastingly between
'turns' while whispering and giggling goes on behind
the scenes."</p>

<p>As a result of Helen's sternness the butterflies
were waiting when the little internationals went off,
and, as those of the children who were not to appear
again filed quietly down into the audience where
they could see the remainder of the performance,
waving wings of soft pink and blue and green and
yellow fluttered in from the sides. There was nothing
intricate about the steps of this pretty dance.
There were movements forward and back and to one
side and another, with an occasional turn, but the
slowly waving hands with their delicate burden of
color made the whole effect entirely charming.</p>

<p>When Tom and Roger, jersey clad, stepped on to
the stage for the club-swinging act all the other
performers were clustered in the wings, for it had
roused their curiosity. Evidently Roger was to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
swing first for he stepped to the front while Tom
beckoned to the janitor of the hall who came forward
and attached electric light wires to a plug in
the edge of the platform. Tom made a connection
with wires that ran up under the back of Roger's
jersey and down his sleeves and through holes bored
into his clubs, and then he stepped forward to the
front.</p>

<p>"While Roger Morton is swinging his clubs the
lights of the hall will be turned off," he explained.
"I mention it so that no one will be startled when
they go out."</p>

<p>Out they went, and in a flash Roger's clubs, made
of red and white striped cotton stretched over wire
frames which covered electric light bulbs screwed to
a sawed-off pair of clubs, were illuminated from
within. The beauty of the movements as the clubs
flashed here and there in simple or elaborate curves
and whirls drew exclamations of enjoyment from
the audience.</p>

<p>"That's one of the prettiest stunts I ever saw,"
exclaimed Doctor Hancock, and Doctor Watkins
led the vigorous applause that begged Roger to go
on. True to his agreement with Helen, however,
Roger stepped aside as soon as he was freed from
his apparatus and the lights were turned on once
more in the hall, and prepared to help Tom.</p>

<p>It was clear that Tom, too, was not going to do
ordinary club-swinging. He took up his position in
the centre of the stage and Roger brought forward
a box which he deposited beside him. The actors
behind the scenes craned their heads forward until
they were visible to the audience, so eager were they
to see what the box contained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"My friend, Tom Watkins," said Roger gravely,
"is something of a naturalist. In the course of his
travels and studies he has come across a curious animal
whose chief characteristic is what I may be permitted
to call its adhesive power. So closely does
it cling to anything to which it attaches itself that it
can be detached only with great difficulty. So
marked is this peculiarity of the <i>Canis Taurus</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>A peculiar grunt of amusement from certain high
school members of the audience interrupted Roger's
oration. "<i>Canis</i>, dog; <i>taurus</i>, bull," they whispered.</p>

<p>"&mdash;of the <i>Canis Taurus</i>," he went on, "that Watkins
has been able to train two of his specimens to do
the very remarkable act that you are about to see."</p>

<p>As he ended he threw back the top of the box and
there popped up over the edge the infinitely ugly
heads of Cupid's two pup's, Amor and Amorette. A
howl of laughter greeted their silly, solemn countenances.
Tom whistled sharply and they sprang from
their narrow quarters and ran to him. He stroked
them, and faced them toward the footlights so that
their eyes should not be dazzled by seeing them suddenly.
Then he began to play with them, pushing
them about and shoving them gently with the ravelled
ends of two short pieces of knotted rope. When he
had teased them for a minute he stood upright and
Amor and Amorette were hanging each from a rope!
It was a trick he had taught them as soon as their
teeth were strong enough.</p>

<p>Slowly he swung them back and forth, and then in
semi-circles constantly increasing in sweep, until in
a flash they rose over his head and described regular
simple Indian club evolutions. Every move was
slow and steady with no jerks that would break the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
dogs' hold and Amor and Amorette held on with a
firmness that did credit to their inheritance of jaw
muscle and determination.</p>

<p>"Good for the <i>Canis Taurus</i>," laughed Mr.
Wheeler, the high school teacher, from the back of
the hall as the swinging died rhythmically away.</p>

<p>"Speak to the ladies and gentlemen," commanded
Tom as he dropped the ropes and their attachments
to the floor. Each dog was still holding firmly to
his bit of rope and manifested no desire to part from
it. At their master's order, however, they let go of
their handles and uttered two sharp barks. Then
they picked them up again and trotted off the stage.</p>

<p>All this was so unusual that it aroused the most
fervent enthusiasm that had yet been shown. Feet
stamped and canes rapped but Tom would do no
more than walk on with a dog on each side of him
and bow as they barked.</p>

<p>With the announcement of the knitting tableau
there was a flutter among the old ladies from the
Home. Here was an act in which they felt a personal
interest. It was almost embarrassing to be so
nearly related to a number on the program!</p>

<p>The curtain rose very slowly to soft music thrilling
through the hall. It was a homely scene&mdash;just
such a room as any one of the old ladies may have
had when she still had a home of her own. There
was a table with a lamp upon it and around the table
were the three old ladies, one with her crutch and
one in her wheel chair, and one sitting in the darkness
that was daylight to her&mdash;the shining of a contented
heart. All of them were knitting.</p>

<p>Slowly there grew into view behind them on the
wall the picture of the thoughts that were in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
minds&mdash;the picture of three children, pale, thin, tear-stained,
trudging along a weary road. Each one
carried a bundle far too heavy for him and each
looked unsmilingly out of the frame, though Mrs.
Morton breathed a sigh of relief when the touching
scene faded and she knew that there was no longer
any danger of Dicky's spoiling the effect by a burst of
laughter or a genial call to some acquaintance in the
audience.</p>

<p>Slowly the curtain fell and the old ladies were lost
to view. Then the old ladies in front breathed a
sigh of satisfaction. It had been simply perfect!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"SISTER SUSIE'S SEWING SHIRTS FOR SOLDIERS"</div>


<div class='cap'>WITH the evening well under way Helen was
beginning to be relieved of the worry that she
had not been able to control, but as the time for the
silhouette approached the Ethels became distinctly
disturbed. Dicky always was an uncertain element.
Because he had behaved like an angel child in the
tableau with the old ladies was no assurance that as
a pussy cat in the silhouettes he would not raise an
uproar which would put to shame any backyard
feline of their acquaintance.</div>

<p>Dicky's companions in the animal play were ready
behind the scenes and their funny costumes were causing
bursts of suppressed mirth as they danced about
excitedly. When Dicky finished his tableau he was
hurried into his maltese coat and by the time that his
Aunt Louise had played the "Owl and the Pussy Cat"
and Dorothy had sung it, the blue curtain had been
lowered, the light behind it turned on, and between
it and the net curtain in front the dogs and the cats
and the rabbits frisked happily. In fact the raising
of the outside curtain caught them tagging each other
about the stage in a manner that was vastly amusing
but had nothing to do with the play.</p>

<p>For there was a little play. The Ethels had made
it up themselves and it had to do not only with a
fisher dog who lost his catch to a robber cat but with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
a clever rabbit who was chased by both dogs and
cats and who took refuge in the rushes on the bank
of the stream and was passed by because his pursuers
mistook the tips of his ears for rushes. Then
they made signs that, wherever he was, if he would
come out and join them they should all be friends.
He came out and they took paws and danced about
in a circle. Against the dull blue background it
looked as if the animals were playing in the moonlight,
jumping and walking on their hindlegs like the
creatures in the fairy books. The small children in
the audience were especially pleased with this number
and when at the end a boy appeared carrying his
schoolbooks and all the animals fell into line behind
him and walked off demurely to school it was so like
what happens at the end of the holidays that they
burst into renewed clapping.</p>

<p>The minuet went with the utmost smoothness.
Doctor Watkins added his violin to the piano's playing
of the Mozart music from "Don Giovanni" and
the picturesquely dressed figures stepped and bowed
and courtesied with grace and precision. Helen
danced with Tom, Margaret with Roger, Ethel
Brown with James, and Ethel Blue with the new boy,
George Foster. The girls all wore ruffled skirts
with paniers elaborately bunched over them, and they
had their hair powdered. The boys wore knee
breeches, long-tailed coats, and white wigs. On the
wall hung an old portrait of a Morton ancestor. A
spinet stood at one side of the room which the stage
represented. The whole atmosphere was that of a
day long gone by.</p>

<p>After this number was done Doctor Watkins appeared
before the curtain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am asked by the president of the United Service
Club," he said, "to tell you that there will be an interval
of ten minutes between the minuet and the next
offering of the program. During that time I am
going to sing you a song that the English soldiers are
singing. It isn't a serious song, for the soldiers are
hearing enough sad sounds without adding to them.
I may make some mistakes in singing it&mdash;you'll
understand why in a moment."</p>

<p>At a nod from him, Mrs. Smith broke into the
opening notes of "Sister Susie's Sewing Shirts for
Soldiers," and by the time the doctor had finished the
second stanza the audience was humming the chorus.
"Come on," he cried. "I did make some mistakes.
See if you can do better," and he led the tune for
the four lines that announced,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Sister Susie's sewing shirts for soldiers.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Such skill at sewing shirts our shy young sister Susie shows,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Some soldiers send epistles, say they'd sooner sleep in thistles</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than the saucy, soft, short shirts for soldiers Sister Susie sews."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Everybody laughed and laughed and tried to sing
and laughed again.</p>

<p>When the chorus was over, Doctor Watkins
dashed into the Allies' song, "Tipperary," and followed
it by "Deutschland ueber Alles." Then he
taught the audience the words of "The Christmas
Ship" and they quickly caught the air and soon were

<p>Edward had a good voice and he sang with so
much spirit that every one enjoyed his unexpected
addition to the evening's pleasure.</p>

<p>A bell behind the scenes announced that "The Pied
Piper of Hamelin" was ready and the curtain rose on
the room in the Town Hall of Hamelin in which the
Corporation held its meetings. Dorothy, whose
voice was clear and far-reaching, stood just below
the stage at one side and read the explanation of what
had been happening in the city.</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Hamelin Town's in Brunswick,</span><br />
By famous Hanover city;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">The river Weser, deep and wide,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Washes its wall on the southern side;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">A pleasanter spot you never spied;</span><br />
But, when begins my ditty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Almost five hundred years ago,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">To see the townsfolk suffer so</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">From vermin, was a pity,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Rats!</span><br />
They fought the dogs and killed the cats,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And bit the babies in the cradles,</span><br />
And ate the cheeses out of the vats,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 6em;">And licked the soup from the cooks' own ladles,</span><br />
Split open the kegs of salted sprats<br />
Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,<br />
And even spoiled the women's chats<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">By drowning their speaking</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">With shrieking and squeaking</span><br />
In fifty different sharps and flats.<br />
<br />
At last the people in a body<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">To the Town Hall came flocking.</span><br />
</div>

<p>At this point the reading stopped and the action
began. Roger, dressed as the Mayor in his mother's
red flannel kimono banded with white stripes to
which he had attached tiny black tails to give the
effect of ermine, stalked in first. He wore a look of
deep anxiety. Behind him came James and two of
Roger's high school friends who represented members
of the Corporation. They also were dressed
in red robes but they did not attempt to equal the
ermine elegance of the Mayor.</p>

<p>After the Mayor and Corporation came a body
of the townspeople. They all appeared thoroughly
enraged and as the city fathers took their seats at
the council table in the centre of the room they
railed at them.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<span class="smcap">First Citizen.</span> [<i>Tom, in rough brown jacket

</div><div class='poem2'>
<span class="smcap">Second Citizen.</span> [<i>George Foster, dressed like Tom.</i>]<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And as for our Corporation&mdash;shocking,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To think we buy gowns lined with ermine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For dolts that can't or won't determine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What's best to rid us of our vermin!"</span><br />
</div><div class='blockquot'>
<span class="smcap">Third Citizen.</span> [<i>Another high school boy. He

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"You hope because you're old and obese,</span><br />

<br />
<span class="smcap">First Citizen.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Rouse up, sirs! Give your brains a racking</span><br />

<br />
<span class="smcap">The Mayor.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I wish I were a mile hence."</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">First Member of the Corporation.</span> [<i>James.</i>]<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"It's easy to bid one rack one's brain&mdash;</span><br />

<br />
<span class="smcap">Second Member of the Corporation.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Oh, for a trap, a trap, a trap."</span><br />
<br /></div><div class='blockquot'>
At this instant came a rap on the door. Helen
did it, and a cry came from <span class="smcap">The Mayor</span>.<br /></div><div class='poem2'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Bless us, what's that?"</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">First Member.</span><br />

<div class="blockquot"><p>In answer to this permission there entered Edward
Watkins as the Pied Piper. He had dashed around
to the back and slipped into his coat and Mrs. Emerson
had painted his face while the first words of the
poem were being read. He was tall and thin with
light hair, yet a swarthy complexion. He wore a
queer long coat, half yellow and half red and around
his neck a scarf of red and yellow in stripes to which
was attached a tiny flute with which his fingers played
as if he were eager to pipe upon it. He smiled winningly
and the people crowded in the council chamber
whispered, wondering who he was and why his
attire was so curious.</p></div>

<div class='poem2'>
<span class="smcap">First Citizen.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"It's as my great-grandsire</span><br />

</div>

<div class="poem2"><span class="smcap">The Pied Piper</span> [<i>Edward Watkins</i>] advanced to
the council table.<br />


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Please your honors, I'm able</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By means of a secret charm to draw</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All creatures living beneath the sun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That creep or swim or fly or run,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">After me so as you never saw!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I chiefly use my charm</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On creatures that do people harm,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The mole and toad and newt and viper;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And people call me the Pied Piper.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet, poor piper as I am,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Tartary I freed the Cham,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Last June from his huge swarms of gnats;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I eased in Asia the Nizam</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of a monstrous brood of vampire bats:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And as for what your brain bewilders</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If I can rid your town of rats</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will you give me a thousand guilders?"</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">The Mayor and Corporation Together.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"One? Fifty thousand!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Then <span class="smcap">The Piper</span> walked slowly across the stage,
erect and smiling, and he piped a strange, simple
tune on his flute. As he disappeared at one side
the stage was darkened and at the back appeared a
picture such as had been used in the tableau of the
old ladies knitting. <span class="smcap">The Mayor</span> and the <span class="smcap">Corporation</span>
and the townsfolk turned their back to the
audience and gazed out through this window.
Across it passed first <span class="smcap">The Piper</span> still piping, and
after him a horde of rats. They were pasteboard
rats and Helen was drawing them across the scene
with strings, but they made a very good illusion of
the dancing rats that the poet described;</p></div>

<div class='poem2'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As the crowd in the room watched they uttered
exclamations&mdash;"See!" "Look at that one!"
"How they follow him!" "He's leading them to the
river!" "In they go!" "They're drowning!"
"Every one of them!" "Let's ring the bells!"</p>

<p>With faces of delight the townsfolk left the council
chamber and from a distance came the muffled ringing
of bells of joy.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem2'>
<span class="smcap">The Mayor</span> addressed them as they passed out;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Go and get long poles,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poke out the nests and block up the holes!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Consult with carpenters and builders,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And leave in our town not even a trace</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the rats."</span><br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">The Piper</span> entered suddenly. "First, if you
please, my thousand guilders!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Member of the Corporation.</span> "A thousand
guilders!"</p>

<p>The other members of the Corporation shook
their heads in solemn refusal.</p></div>

<div class='poem2'>
<span class="smcap">The Mayor.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Our business was done at the river's brink;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We saw with our eyes the vermin sink,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And what's dead can't come to life, I think."</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Second Member of the Corporation.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"So, friend, we're not the folks to shrink</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the duty of giving you something for drink,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a matter of money to put in your poke&mdash;"</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">The Mayor.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But as for the guilders, what we spoke</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of them, as you very well know, was in joke."</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">First Member.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Besides, our losses have made us thrifty.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!"</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">The Piper</span> [<i>looking serious, cried</i>];<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"No trifling! I can't wait, beside!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've promised to visit by dinner time</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bagdat, and accept the prime</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the Head-Cook's pottage, all he's rich in,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For having left in the Caliph's kitchen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of a nest of scorpions no survivor;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With him I proved no bargain-driver,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With you, don't think I'll bate a stiver!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And folks who put me in a passion</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May find me pipe after another fashion."</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">The Mayor.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"How? D'ye think I brook</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Being worse treated than a Cook?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Insulted by a lazy ribald</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With idle pipe and vesture piebald?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You threaten us, fellow? Do your worst,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blow your pipe there till you burst!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Once more the Piper laid the pipe against his lips
and blew the strange, simple tune, and from both
sides of the stage there came rushing in children of
all sizes, boys and girls, flaxen-haired and dark-haired,
blue-eyed and brown-eyed. They crowded
around him and as he slowly passed off the stage
they followed him, dancing and waving their hands
and with never a look behind them.</p>

<p>Once more the window at the back opened and
across it went the Piper, still fluting, though now he
could not be heard by the audience; and behind him
still danced the children, blind to the gestures of
the Mayor and Corporation who stretched out their
arms, beseeching them to return. Terrified, the city
fathers made known by gestures of despair that they
feared the Piper was leading the children to the river
where they would meet the fate of the rats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Of a sudden they seemed relieved and the picture
showed the throng passing out of sight into a cavern
on the mountain. Then limped upon the stage a
lame boy who had not been able to dance all the
way with the children and so was shut out when the
mountain opened and swallowed them up. The
Corporation crowded around him and heard him
say:</p></div>

<div class='poem2'>
<span class="smcap">Lame Boy.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"It's dull in our town since my playmates left!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I can't forget that I'm bereft</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of all the pleasant sights they see,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which the Piper also promised me.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Joining the town and just at hand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where waters gushed and fruit trees grew</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And flowers put forth a fairer hue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And everything was strange and new;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And their dogs outran our fallow deer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And honey bees had lost their stings,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And horses were born with eagles' wings;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And just as I became assured</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My lame foot would be speedily cured,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The music stopped and I stood still,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And found myself outside the hill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Left alone against my will,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To go now limping as before,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never hear of that country more!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The <span class="smcap">Mayor</span> and <span class="smcap">Corporation</span> were grouped
around the <span class="smcap">Lame Boy</span> listening and the citizens at
the back leaned forward so as to hear every word.
Almost in tears the boy limped from the stage followed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
slowly by Mayor and Corporation and citizens
while Dorothy's clear voice took up the tale.</p></div>

<div class='poem'>
"Alas, alas for Hamelin!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There came into many a burgher's pate</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A text which says that heaven's gate</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Opes to the rich at as easy rate</span><br />
As the needle's eye takes a camel in!<br />
The Mayor sent East, West, North, and South,<br />
To offer the Piper by word or mouth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wherever it was men's lot to find him,</span><br />
Silver and gold to his heart's content,<br />
If he'd only return the way he went,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And bring the children behind him.</span><br />
But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavor,<br />
And Piper and dancers were gone forever,<br />
They made a decree that lawyers never<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Should think their records dated duly</span><br />
If, after the day of the month and year,<br />
These words did not as well appear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'And so long after what happened here</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On the Twenty-second of July,</span><br />

They called it the Pied Piper's Street&mdash;<br />
Where any one playing on pipe or tabor<br />
Was sure for the future to lose his labor.<br />
Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To shock with mirth a street so solemn:</span><br />
But opposite the place of the cavern<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They wrote the story on a column,</span><br />
And on the great church window painted<br />
The same, to make the world acquainted<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>How their children were stolen away,<br />
And there it stands to this very day.<br />
And I must not omit to say<br />
That in Transylvania there's a tribe<br />
Of alien people who ascribe<br />
The outlandish ways and dress<br />
On which their neighbors lay such stress,<br />
To their fathers and mothers having risen<br />
Out of some subterraneous prison<br />
Into which they were trepanned<br />
Long time ago in a mighty band<br />
Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land.<br />
But how or why, they don't understand."<br />

<p>At the conclusion of the play, after hearty applause,
the audience broke again into the song of the
Christmas Ship:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Hurrah, hurrah for the Christmas Ship<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As it starts across the sea</span><br />
With its load of gifts and its greater load<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of loving sympathy.</span><br />
Let's wave our hats and clap our hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As we send it on its trip;</span><br />
May many a heart and home be cheered<br />

<p>"That's as good a show as if it had been put on by
grown-ups," declared a New Yorker who had come
out with Doctor Watkins. "It's hard to believe that
those kids have done it all themselves."</p>

<p>He spoke to a stranger beside him as they filed
out to the music of a merry march played by Mrs.
Smith.</p>

<p>"My boy was among them," replied the Rosemont
man proudly, "but I don't mind saying I think they're
winners!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>That seemed to be every one's opinion. As for
the old ladies&mdash;the evening was such an event to them
that they felt just a trifle uncertain that they had not
been transported by some magic means to far away
Hamelin town.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I missed a word," said the blind
old lady as the horses toiled slowly up the hill to the
Home.</p>

<p>"We'll tell you every scene so you'll know how the
words fit in," promised the old lady in the wheel
chair.</p>

<p>"It will be something to talk about when we're
knitting," chuckled the lame old lady brightly, and
they all hummed gently,</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>JAMES CUTS CORNERS</div>


<div class='cap'>"VERY creditable, very creditable indeed," repeated
Doctor Hancock as he and James
stepped into their car to return to Glen Point after
packing the old ladies into the wagonette.</div>

<p>Mrs. Hancock and Margaret had gone home by
trolley because the doctor had to make a professional
call on the way. The moon lighted the road brilliantly
and the machine flew along smoothly over the
even surface.</p>

<p>"This is about as near flying as a fellow can get
and still be only two feet from the earth," said
James.</p>

<p>James was quiet and almost too serious for a boy
of his age but he had one passion that sometimes got
the better of the prudence which he inherited from
the Scottish ancestor about whom Roger was always
joking him.</p>

<p>That passion was for speed. When he was a
very small child he had made it his habit to descend
the stairs by way of the rail at the infinite risk of his
neck. Once he had run his head through the slats
of a chicken coop into which an over-swift hopmobile
had thrown him. On roller skates his accidents had
been beyond counting because his calculations of
distance often seemed not to work out harmoniously
with his velocity. It was because Doctor Hancock
thought that if the boy had the responsibility for his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
father's machine and for other people's bones he
would learn to exercise proper care, that he had consented
to let him become his chauffeur. The plan
had seemed to work well, but once in a while the
desire to fly got the better of James's discretion.</p>

<p>"Here's where the car gets ahead of the aeroplane,"
said the doctor. "An aviator would find it
dangerous work to skim along only two feet above
ground."</p>

<p>"I did want to go up with that airman at Chautauqua
last summer!" cried James.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Cost too much. Twenty-five plunks."</p>

<p>The doctor whistled.</p>

<p>"Flying high always costs," he said meditatively.</p>

<p>"The Ethels went up. They haven't done talking
about it yet. They named the man's machine,
so he gave them a ride."</p>

<p>"Good work! Look out for these corners, now.
When you've studied physics a bit longer you'll learn
why it is that a speeding body can't change its direction
at an angle of ninety degrees and maintain its
equilibrium unless it decreases its speed."</p>

<p>James thought this over for a while.</p>

<p>"In other words, slow up going round corners,"
he translated, "and later I'll learn why."</p>

<p>"Words to that effect," replied the doctor mildly.</p>

<p>"Here's a good straight bit," exclaimed James.
"You don't care if I let her out, do you? There's
nothing in sight."</p>

<p>"Watch that cross road."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Isn't this moon great!" murmured
James under his breath, excited by the brilliant light
and the cool air and the swift motion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Always keep your eyes open for these heavy
shadows that the moon casts," directed Doctor Hancock.
"Sometimes they're deceptive."</p>

<p>"I'll keep in the middle of the road and then the
bugaboo in the shadow can see us even if I can't see
him," laughed James, the moonlight in his eyes and
the rush of wind in his ears.</p>

<p>"There's something moving there! LOOK
OUT!" shouted the doctor as a cow strolled slowly
out from behind a tree and chewed a meditative cud
right across their path. James made a swift, abrupt
curve, and did not touch her.</p>

<p>"That was a close one," he whispered, his hands
shaking on the wheel.</p>

<p>"It hasn't worried her any," reported his father,
looking back. "She hasn't budged and she's still
chewing. You did that very well, son. It was a
difficult situation."</p>

<p>James flushed warmly. His father was not a man
to give praise often so that every word of commendation
from him was doubly valued by his children.</p>

<p>"Thank you. I shouldn't like to have it happen
every day," James confessed.</p>

<p>They sped on in silence after the cow episode, the
boy glad of the chance to steady his nerves in the
quiet, the doctor thinking of the case he was to visit
in a few minutes.</p>

<p>The patient's house stood on the edge of Glen
Point, and James sat in the car resting and watching
the machines of the townspeople passing by with gay
parties out to enjoy the moonlight. Some, like themselves,
had been to Rosemont, and some of his
schoolmates waved to him as they passed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was a great show, old man," more than one
boy shouted to him.</p>

<p>It had been a good show. He knew it and he was
glad that he belonged to a club that really amounted
to something. They did things well and they didn't
do them well just to show off or to get praise&mdash;they
had a good purpose behind. He was still thinking
about it when his father came out. Doctor Hancock
did not talk about his cases, but James had
learned that silence meant that there was need for
serious thought and that the doctor was in no mood
to enter into conversation. When he came out
laughing, however, and jumped into the car with a
care-free jest, as happened now, James knew that all
was going well.</p>

<p>"Now, home, boy," he directed. "Stop at the
drug store an instant."</p>

<p>He gave some directions to a clerk who hurried
out to them and then they drove on. The moonlight
sifted through the trees and flickered on the
road. A cool breeze stimulated James's skin to a
shiver. On they went, faster and faster. He'd
had a mighty good time all the evening, James
thought, and Father was a crackerjack.</p>

<p>"LOOK OUT, boy," his father's voice rang
through his thoughts. The car struck the curb with
a shock that loosened his grasp on the wheel and
tossed him into the air. As he flew up he tried to
say, "I cut the corner too close that time," but he
never knew whether he said it or not, for his voice
seemed to fail him and his father could not recall
hearing such a remark.</p>

<p>It was quite an hour later when he came to himself.
To his amazement he found himself in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
own room. The light was shaded, his mother with
tears still filling her eyes was beside him, and his
father and a young man whom he recognized as the
new doctor who had just come to Glen Point, were
putting away instruments. He tried to move in the
bed and found that his leg was extraordinarily heavy.</p>

<p>"Did I bust my leg?" he inquired briefly.</p>

<p>"You did," returned his father with equal brevity.</p>

<p>"Weren't you hurt?"</p>

<p>"A scratch on the forehead, that's all. Doctor
Hanson is going to patch me up now."</p>

<p>The two physicians left the room and James did
not know until long after that the scratch required
several stitches to mend.</p>

<p>His illness was a severe trial to James. His Scottish
blood taught him that his punishment fitted his
crime&mdash;that he was hurt as a direct result of doing
what he knew was likely to bring that result. He
said to himself that he was going to take his punishment
like a man. But oh, the days were long!
The Glen Point boys came in when they thought of
it&mdash;there was some one almost every day&mdash;but the
Indian Summer was unusually prolonged and wonderfully
beautiful this year, and it was more than
any one could ask in reason that the boys should give
up outdoors to stay with him. Roger and Helen
and the Ethels and Dorothy came over from Rosemont
when they could, but their daily work had to be
done and they had only a few minutes to stay after
the long trolley trip.</p>

<p>"We must think up something for James to do,"
Mrs. Hancock told Margaret. "He's tired of reading.
He can use his hands. Hasn't your Service
Club something that he can work on here?" Margaret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
thought it had, and the result of the conversation
was that Mrs. Hancock went to Rosemont on an
afternoon car. The Ethels took her to Mrs. Smith's
and Dorothy showed her the accumulation for the
Christmas Ship that already was making a good
showing in the attic devoted to the work.</p>

<p>"These bundles in the packing cases are all finished
and ready for their final wrappings," Dorothy explained.
"There are dresses and wrappers and
sacques and sweaters and all sorts of warm clothing
like that."</p>

<p>"And you girls did almost all of it!" exclaimed
Mrs. Hancock.</p>

<p>"Helen and Margaret made most of those," said
Ethel Brown. "In this box are the knitted articles
that are coming in every day now. Most of them
are from the Old Ladies' Home so far, but every
once in a while somebody else stops and leaves something.
We girls don't knit much; it seems to go so
slowly."</p>

<p>"I brought one pair of wristers with me and I have
another pair almost done," said Mrs. Hancock.
"What are these?"</p>

<p>"Those are the boxes the boys have been pasting,"
said Ethel Blue, picking up one of them. "They
began with the large plain ones first&mdash;the real packing
boxes."</p>

<p>"Here are some that are large enough for a
dress."</p>

<p>"We've gathered all the old boxes we could find in
our house or in our friends' houses&mdash;Margaret must
have hunted in your attic for she brought over some
a fortnight ago. None of the things we are making
will require a box as large as the tailors send out,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
so we took those boxes and the broken ones that we
found and made them over."</p>

<p>"That must have taken a great deal of time."</p>

<p>"The boys paste pretty fast now. Some of them
they made to lock together. They didn't need anything
but cutting. They got that idea from a tailor's
box that Roger found."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hancock examined the flat pasteboard cut
so that the corners would interlock.</p>

<p>"The old boxes they cut down. That saves buying
new pasteboard. And they've covered some of
the battered looking old ones with fresh paper so
they look as good as new&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And a great deal prettier," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"We get wall paper at ten cents a roll for the
covering," said Ethel Blue. "They have an old-fashioned
air that's attractive, Aunt Marion says,"
and she held up a box covered with wild roses.</p>

<p>"They're lovely! And they must have cost you
almost nothing."</p>

<p>"We did these when our treasury was very low.
Now we've got almost fifty dollars that we cleared
from our entertainment after we paid all our bills
and repaid Mother what we owed her," explained
Ethel Brown, "so now the boys can get some fresh
cardboard and some chintz and cretonne and make
some real beauties."</p>

<p>"Is this what James has been doing on Saturdays?"</p>

<p>"James is the best paster of all, he's so careful.
He always makes his corners as neat as pins. Sometimes
the other boys are careless."</p>

<p>"Then I don't see why James couldn't do some of
this at home now. He has altogether too much time
on his hands."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't he study yet?"</p>

<p>"He learns his lessons but his father doesn't want
him to go to school for at least a fortnight and perhaps
not then, so he has long hours with nothing to
do except read and it isn't good for him to do that
all the time."</p>

<p>"We've got a lot of ideas for pasting that we've
been waiting for time and cash to put into operation,"
said Helen who had come in in time to hear Mrs.
Hancock's complaint. "If James could have an old
table that you didn't mind his getting sticky, next to
his wheel chair he could do a quantity of things that
we want very much, and it would help, oh, tremendously."</p>

<p>"Tell me about them," and Mrs. Hancock sat
down at once to receive her instructions. Helen
brought a sheet of paper and made a list of materials
to be bought and drew some of the articles over
which she thought that James might be puzzled.</p>

<p>"Some of these ideas we got from magazines,"
she said, "and some people told us and some we invented
ourselves. They aren't any of them very
large."</p>

<p>"James will like that. It is more fun to turn off a
number of articles. When he has an array standing
on his table you must all go over to Glen Point
and see them."</p>

<p>"We thought that perhaps you'd let us have a
meeting of the U. S. C. at your house one Saturday
afternoon, and we could take over some of our work
to show James and we could see his, and we could
work while we were there," suggested Helen diffidently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're as good as gold to think of it! It will
be the greatest pleasure to James. Shall we say this
next Saturday?"</p>

<p>The girls agreed that that would be a good time,
and Mrs. Hancock went home laden with materials
for James's pasting operations and bearing the pleasant
news of the coming of the Club to meet with him.</p>

<p>Long before the hour at which they were expected
James rolled himself to the window to wait for their
coming. Now that the leaves were off the trees he
could just see the car stop at the end of the street
and he watched eagerly for the flock of young people
to run toward the house. It seemed an interminable
wait, yet the car on which they had promised to come
was not a minute late when at last it halted and its
eager passengers stepped off. James could see the
Ethels leading the procession, waving their hands
toward the window at which they knew he must be,
although they could not see him until they came much
nearer.</p>

<p>Dorothy followed them not far behind, and Roger
and Helen brought up the rear. Every one of them
was laden with parcels of the strangest shapes.</p>

<p>"I know the conductor thought we were Santa
Claus's own children," laughed Ethel Blue as they
all shook hands with the invalid and inquired after
his leg.</p>

<p>"We've come up to have a pasting bee," said
Helen, "and we all have ideas for you to carry out."</p>

<p>"So have we," cried a new voice at the door, and
Della and Tom came in, also laden with parcels and
also bubbling with pleasure at seeing James so well
again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"We shall need quantities of smallish presents that
you can manage here at your table just splendidly,"
explained Ethel Brown.</p>

<p>"And dozens of wrappings of various kinds that
you can make, too."</p>

<p>"Great and glorious," beamed James. "'Lay on,
Macduff.' I'll absorb every piece of information
you give me, like a wet sponge."</p>

<p>"Let's do things in shipshape fashion," directed
Roger. "What do you say to boxes first? We'll
lay out here our patterns, and materials."</p>

<p>"Let's make one apiece of everything," cried
Dorothy, "and leave them all for James to copy."</p>

<p>"And we can open the other bundles afterwards,"
said Della, "then those materials won't get mixed up
with the box materials."</p>

<p>"Save the papers and strings," advised Ethel
Brown. "We're going to need a fearful amount of
both when wrapping time comes."</p>

<p>"The secretary has had a letter from Mademoiselle,"
Helen informed the invalid.</p>

<p>"Where from?" James was aflame with interest.</p>

<p>"She's in Belgium; you know she said she was
going to try to be sent there. She doesn't mention
the name of the town, but she's near enough to the
front for wounded to be brought in from the field."</p>

<p>"And she can hear the artillery booming all the
time," contributed Ethel Blue.</p>

<p>"And one day she went out right on to the firing
line to give first aid."</p>

<p>"Think of that! Our little teacher!"</p>

<p>"She wasn't given those black eyes for nothing!
She's game right through!" laughed Helen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PASTING</div>


<div class='cap'>"SOME of these ideas will be more appropriate
for Christmas gifts here in America than for
our war orphans, it seems to me," said Helen, "but
we may as well make a lot of everything because we'll
be doing some Christmas work as a club and nothing
will be lost."</div>

<p>"Tell me what they are and I can do them last,"
said James.</p>

<p>"And we can put them on a shelf in the club attic
as models," suggested Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Here's an example," said Helen, taking up a
pasteboard cylinder. "This is a mailing tube&mdash;you
know those mailing tubes that you can buy all made,
of different sizes. We've brought down a lot of
them to-day. Take this fat one, for instance, and
cut it off about three inches down. Then cover it
with chintz or cretonne or flowered paper or holly
paper."</p>

<p>"Line it with the paper, too, I should say," commented
James, picking up the pieces that Helen cut
off.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. Cover two round pieces and fit one
of them into the bottom and fasten the other on for
a cover with a ribbon hinge, and there you have a
box for string, or rubber bands for somebody's desk."</p>

<p>"O.K. for rubber bands," agreed Roger, "but for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
string it would be better to make a hole in the cover
and let the cord run up through."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 365px;">
<img src="images/p140.jpg" width="365" height="500" alt="String Box made from a Mailing Tube" title="" />
<span class="caption">String Box made from a Mailing Tube</span>
</div>

<p>"How would you keep the cover from flopping up
and down when you pulled the string?"</p>

<p>"Here's one very simple way. You know those
fasteners that stationers sell to keep papers together?
They have a brass head and two legs and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
when you've pushed the legs through the papers you
press them apart and they can't pull out. One of
those will do very well as a knob to go on the box
part, and a loop of gold or silver cord or of ribbon
can be pasted or tied on to the cover."</p>

<p>"If you didn't care whether it was ever used again
you could put in the ball of twine with its end sticking
through and then paste a band of paper around
the joining of the top and the box. It would be
pretty as long as the twine lasted."</p>

<p>"It would be a simple matter for the person who
became its proud possessor to paste on another strip
of paper when he had put in his new ball of twine."</p>

<p>"Any way you fix it," went on Helen, "there you
have the general method of making round boxes
from these mailing tubes."</p>

<p>"And you can use round boxes for a dozen purposes,"
said Margaret; "for candy and all the
goodies we're going to send the orphans."</p>

<p>"Are you sure they'll keep?" asked careful James.</p>

<p>"Ethel Brown asked the domestic science teacher
at school about that, and she's going to give her
receipts for cookies and candies that will last at least
six weeks. That will be long enough for the Christmas
Ship to go over and to make the rounds of the
ports where it is to distribute presents."</p>

<p>"Of course we'll make the eatables at the last
minute," said Dorothy, "and we'll pack them so as
to keep the air out as much as possible."</p>

<p>"Give that flour paste a good boiling," Helen
called after Margaret as she left the room to prepare
it.</p>

<p>"And don't forget the oil of cloves to keep it
sweet," added Ethel Blue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"These round boxes will be especially good for the
cookies," said Ethel Brown, "though the string box
would have to go to Father. A string box isn't
especially suitable for an orphan."</p>

<p>"If you split these mailing tubes lengthwise and
line them inside you get some pretty shapes," went on
Helen.</p>

<p>"Rather shallow," commented Della.</p>

<p>"If you split them just in halves they are, but you
don't have to do that. Split them a little above the
middle and then the cover will be shallower than the
box part."</p>

<p>"Right-o," nodded Roger.</p>

<p>"Then you line them and arrange the fastening
and hinges just as you described for the string box?"
asked James.</p>

<p>"Exactly the same. Another way of fastening
them is by making little chintz straps and putting
glove snappers on them."</p>

<p>"I don't see why you couldn't put ribbons into both
cover and box part and tie them together."</p>

<p>"You could."</p>

<p>"You can use these split open ones for a manicure
set or a brush and comb box for travelling."</p>

<p>"Or a handkerchief box."</p>

<p>"If you get tubes of different sizes and used military
hair brushes you could make a box for a man,
with a cover that slipped over for a long way," said
Ethel Blue. "It would be just like the leather ones."</p>

<p>"You make one of those for Uncle Richard for
Christmas," advised Ethel Brown. "I rather think
the orphans aren't keen on military brushes."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm just talking out any ideas that come
along. As Helen suggested, an idea is always useful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
some time or other even if it won't do for to-day's
orphans."</p>

<p>"I saw a dandy box the other day that we might
have put into Mademoiselle's kit," said Roger.
"It's a good thing to remember for some other
traveller."</p>

<p>"Describe," commanded James.</p>

<p>"I don't think these round boxes would be as convenient
for it as a square or oblong one. It had a
ball of string and a tube of paste and a pair of small
scissors, and tags of different sizes and rubber bands
and labels with gum on the back."</p>

<p>"That's great for a desk top," said Della. "I believe
I'll make one for Father for his birthday," and
she nodded toward Tom who nodded back approvingly.</p>

<p>"A big blotter case is another desk gift. The
back is of very stiff cardboard and the corners are of
chintz or leather. The blotters are slipped under
the corners and are kept flat by them," continued
Roger, who had noticed them because of their leather
corners.</p>

<p>"A lot of small blotters tied together are easy to
put up," contributed Dorothy. "You can have
twelve, if you want to, and paste a calendar for a
month on to each one."</p>

<p>"I think we ought to make those plain boxes the
boys have made for the dresses a little prettier.
Can't we ornament them in some way?" asked Ethel
Blue.</p>

<p>"The made-over ones are all covered with fancy
paper you remember," said Tom.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of the plain ones that are 'neat
but not gaudy.' How can we make them 'gaudy'?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Christmas seals are about as easy a decoration
as you can get," Tom suggested.</p>

<p>"Pretty, too. Those small seals, you mean, that
you put on letters. A Santa Claus or a Christmas
tree or a poinsettia would look pretty on the smaller
sized boxes."</p>

<p>"It would take a lot of them to show much on the
larger ones, and that would make them rather expensive.
Can't we think up something cheaper?"
asked the treasurer.</p>

<p>"I'm daffy over wall paper," cried Dorothy. "I
went with Mother to pick out some for one of our
rooms the other day and the man showed us such
beauties&mdash;they were like paintings."</p>

<p>"And cost like paintings, too," growled James feelingly.</p>

<p>"Some of them did," admitted Dorothy. "But I
asked him if he didn't have remnants sometimes.
He laughed and said they didn't call them remnants
but he said they did have torn pieces and for ten cents
he gave me a regular armful. Just look at these
beauties."</p>

<p>She held up for the others' inspection some pieces
of paper with lovely flower designs upon them.</p>

<p>"But those bits aren't big enough to cover a big
box and the patterns are too large to show except on
a big box," objected Margaret who had come back
with the paste.</p>

<p>"Here's where they're just the thing for decoration
of the plain boxes. Cut out this perfectly darling
wistaria&mdash;so. Could you find anything more
graceful than that? You'd have to be an artist to
do anything so good. Paste that sweeping, drooping
vine with its lovely cluster of blossoms on to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
top of one of the largest boxes and that's plenty of
decoration."</p>

<p>Dorothy waved her vine in one hand and her
scissors in the other and the rest became infected
with her enthusiasm, for the scraps of paper that
she had brought were exquisite in themselves and
admirable for the purpose she suggested.</p>

<p>"Good for Dorothy!" hurrahed James. "Anybody
else got any ideas on this decoration need?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p145.jpg" width="400" height="136" alt="&quot;Paste that vine on to the top of one of the largest boxes&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Paste that vine on to the top of one of the largest boxes&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"I have," came meekly from Ethel Brown. "It
isn't very novel but it will work, and it will save
money and it's easy."</p>

<p>"Trot her forth," commanded Roger.</p>

<p>"It's silhouettes."</p>

<p>Silence greeted this suggestion.</p>

<p>"They're not awfully easy to do," said Helen
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Not when you make them out of black paper,
and you have to draw on the pattern or trace it on
and you can hardly see the lines and you get all fussed
up over it," acknowledged Ethel. "I've tried that
way and I almost came to the conclusion that it wasn't
worth the trouble I put into it unless you happened
to be a person who can cut them right out without
drawing them first."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw a man do that at a bazar once," said
Della. "It was wonderful. He illustrated Cinderella.
He cut out a coach and tiny horses and the
old fairy without drawing anything at all beforehand."</p>

<p>"Nothing doing here," Tom pushed away an
imaginary offer of scissors and black paper.</p>

<p>"Here's where my grand idea comes in," insisted
Ethel Brown. "My idea is to cut out of the magazines
any figures that please you."</p>

<p>"Figures with action would be fun," suggested
Roger.</p>

<p>"They'd be prettiest, too. You'll find them in the
advertising pages as well as in the stories. Paste
them on to your box or whatever you want to decorate,
and then go over them with black oil paint."</p>

<p>"Good for old Ethel Brown!" applauded her
brother. "I didn't think you had it in you, child!
Have you ever tried it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I have. I knew I'd probably meet with
objections from an unimaginative person like you,
so I decorated this cover and brought it along as a
sample."</p>

<p>It proved to be an idea as dashing as it was simple.
Ethel Brown had selected a girl rolling a hoop. A
dog, cut from another page, was bounding beside
her. Some delicate foliage at one side hinted at a
landscape.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it hard not to let the black run over the
edges of the picture?" asked Della.</p>

<p>"Yes, you have to keep your wits about you all
the time. But then you have to do that any way if
you want what you're making to amount to anything,
so that doesn't count."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's a capital addition, that suggestion of
ground that you made with a whisk or two of the
brush."</p>

<p>"Just a few lines seem to give the child something
to stand on."</p>

<p>"These plans for decoration look especially good
to me," said practical James, "because there's nothing
to stick up on them. They'll pack easily and that's
what we must have for our purpose."</p>

<p>"That's true," agreed Helen. "For doing up
presents that don't have to travel it's pretty to cut
petals of red poinsettia and twist them with wire and
make a flower that you can tuck in under the string
that you tie the parcel with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or a bit of holly. Holly is easily made out of
green cr&ecirc;pe paper or tissue paper," cried Della.</p>

<p>"But as James says, none of the boxes for the
orphans can have stick-ups or they'll look like mashed
potatoes when they reach the other side."</p>

<p>"We'll stow away the poinsettia idea for home
presents then," said Margaret. "What we want
from James, however, is a lot of boxes of any and
every size that he can squeeze out."</p>

<p>"No scraps thrown away, old man," decreed Tom,
"for even a cube of an inch each way will hold a few
sweeties."</p>

<p>"Orders received and committed to memory,"
acknowledged the invalid, saluting.</p>

<p>"By the way, I learned an awfully interesting thing
to-day," said Helen.</p>

<p>"Name it," commanded Roger, busy with knife
and pastepot making one of the twine and tag boxes
that he had described.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you while we each make one of the things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
we've been talking about so that we can leave them
for patterns with James."</p>

<p>Dorothy had already set about applying her wistaria
vine to the cover of a box whose body Tom
was putting together. Ethel Blue was making a
string box from a mailing tube, covering it with a
scrap of chintz with a very small design; Ethel Brown
was hunting in an old magazine for figures suitable
for making silhouettes; James was writing in a notebook
the various hints that had been bestowed upon
him so generously that he feared his memory would
not hold them all without help; Helen and Della were
measuring and cutting some cotton cloth that was to
be used in the gifts that Della was eager to tell about.</p>

<p>"By the time Helen has told her tale I'll be ready
to explain my gift idea," she said.</p>

<p>"Go on, then, Helen," urged James, "I'm ready
to 'start something' myself, in a minute."</p>

<p>"You and Margaret have heard us talk about our
German teacher?"</p>

<p>"We've seen her," said Margaret. "She was at
our entertainment."</p>

<p>"So she was. I remember, she and her mother
sat right behind the old ladies from the Home."</p>

<p>"And they knitted for the soldiers whenever the
lights were up."</p>

<p>"I guess Mrs. Hindenburg knitted when the lights
were off, too," said Helen. "I've seen her knitting
with her eyes shut."</p>

<p>"She sent in some more wristers for the orphans
the other day," said Dorothy. "She has made seven
pairs so far, and three scarfs and two little sweaters."</p>

<p>"Some knitter," announced Roger.</p>

<p>"Fr&auml;ulein knits all the time, too, but she says she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
can't keep up with her mother. This is what I
wanted to tell you&mdash;you remember when Roger first
went there she told him that Fr&auml;ulein's betrothed was
in the German army. Well, yesterday she told us
who he is."</p>

<p>"Is it all right for you to tell us?" warned Roger.</p>

<p>"It's no secret. She said that the engagement was
to have been announced as soon as he got back from
Germany and that many people knew it already."</p>

<p>"Is he an American German?"</p>

<p>"It's our own Mr. Schuler."</p>

<p>Roger gave a whistle of surprise; the Ethels cried
out in wonder, and the Hancocks and the Watkinses
who did not know many Rosemont people, waited for
the explanation.</p>

<p>"Mr. Schuler was the singing teacher in the high
school year before last and last year," explained
Helen. "Last spring he had to go back to Germany
in May so he was there when the army was mobilized
and went right to the front."</p>

<p>"It does come near home when you actually know
a soldier fighting in the German army and a nurse in
a hospital on the Allies' side," said Roger thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"It makes it a lot more exciting to know who Fr&auml;ulein's
betrothed is."</p>

<p>"Does she speak of him?" asked Margaret.</p>

<p>"She talked about him very freely yesterday after
her mother mentioned his name."</p>

<p>"I suppose she didn't want the high school kids
gossiping about him," observed Roger.</p>

<p>"As we are," interposed James.</p>

<p>"We aren't gossiping," defended Helen. "She
looks on the Club members as her special friends&mdash;she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
said so. She knows we wouldn't go round at
school making a nine days' wonder of it. She knows
we're fond of her."</p>

<p>"We are," agreed Roger. "She's a corker. I
wonder we didn't think of its being Mr. Schuler."</p>

<p>"Her mother always mentioned him as 'my daughter's
betrothed'; and Fr&auml;ulein yesterday kept saying
'my betrothed.' We might have gone on in ignorance
for a long time if Mrs. Hindenburg hadn't let
it slip out yesterday."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope he'll come through with all his legs
and arms uninjured," said Roger. "I hope it for
Fr&auml;ulein's sake, and for his, too. He's a bully singing
teacher."</p>

<p>"Has she heard from him since the war began?"</p>

<p>"Several times, but not for a month now, and she's
about crazy with anxiety. He was in Belgium when
he got the last letter through and of course that
means that he has been in the very thick of it all."</p>

<p>"Poor Fr&auml;ulein!" sighed Ethel Blue, and the
others nodded seriously over their work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>JAMES'S AFTERNOON PARTY</div>


<div class='cap'>"NOW are you ready to take in all the difficulties
of my art object?" asked Della.</div>

<p>"Trot her out," implored James.</p>

<p>"It's picture books."</p>

<p>A distinct sniff went over the assembly, only kept
in check by a desire to be polite.</p>

<p>"There can't be anything awfully new about picture
books," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Especially cloth picture books. You and Helen
have been cutting out cambric for cloth picture
books," accused Ethel Brown.</p>

<p>"Della has been making some variations, though."
Helen came to Della's rescue. "She's made some
with the leaves all one color, pink or blue; and here's
another one with a variety&mdash;two pages light pink,
and the next two pages pale green."</p>

<p>Ethel Brown cast a more interested eye toward
the picture book display.</p>

<p>"How do you sew them together?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You can do it on the machine and let it go at
that. In fact, that's the best plan even if you go on
to add some decoration of feather-stitching or cat-stitching.
The machine stitching makes it firmer."</p>

<p>"Is there an interlining?"</p>

<p>"I tried them with and without an interlining. I
don't think an interlining is necessary. The two
thicknesses of cambric are all you need."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dicky has a cloth book with just one thickness
for each page," said Ethel Brown.</p>

<p>"But that's made of very heavy cotton," explained
Helen.</p>

<p>"You cut your cambric like a sheet of note-paper,"
said Della.</p>

<p>"Haven't my lessons on scientific management
soaked in better than that?" demanded Roger. "If
you want to save time you cut just as many sheets of
note-paper, so to speak, as your scissors will go
through."</p>

<p>"Certainly," retorted Della with dignity. "I
took it for granted that the members of the U. S. C.
had learned that. Put two sheets of this cambric
note-paper together flat and stitch them. That
makes four pages to paste on, you see. You can
make your book any size you want to and have just
as many pages as you need to tell your story on."</p>

<p>"Story? What story?" asked Ethel Blue, interestedly.</p>

<p>"Aha! I thought you'd wake up!" laughed
Della. "Here, my children, is where my book differs
from most of the cloth picture books that you
ever saw. My books aren't careless collections of
pictures, with no relation to each other. Here's a
cat book, for instance. Not just every-day cats,
though I've put in lots of cats and some kodaks of
my own cat. There are pictures of the big cats&mdash;lions
and tigers&mdash;and I've put in some scenery so
that the child who gets this book will have an idea
of what sort of country the beasts really live in."</p>

<p>"It's a natural history book," declared James.</p>

<p>"Partly. But it winds up with 'The True Story
of Thomas's Nine Lives.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"The kid it is going to won't know English," objected
Roger.</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't written it out. It's just told in
pictures with 1, 2, 3, through 9 at the head of each
page. They'll understand."</p>

<p>"Do you see what an opportunity the different colored
cambric gives?" said Helen. "Sometimes
Della uses colored pictures or she paints them, and
then she makes the background harmonize with the
coloring of the figures."</p>

<p>"Why couldn't you make a whole book of my silhouettes?"
demanded Ethel Brown.</p>

<p>"Bully!" commended James.</p>

<p>"You can work out all sorts of topics in these
books, you see," Della went on. "There are all the
fairy stories to illustrate and 'Red Riding Hood,'
and the 'Bears,' and when you get tired of making
those you can have one about 'The Wonders of
America,' and put in Niagara."</p>

<p>"And the Rocky Mountains," said Tom.</p>

<p>"And the Woolworth Building," suggested Ethel
Brown.</p>

<p>"And a cotton field with the negroes picking cotton,"
added Ethel Blue.</p>

<p>"There wouldn't be any trouble getting material
for that one," said Helen.</p>

<p>"Nor for one on any American city. I've got
one started that is going to show New York from
the statue of Liberty to the Jumel Mansion and
the Van Cortland House, with a lot of other historical
buildings and skyscrapers and museums in between."</p>

<p>"We'll be promoting emigration from the old
country after the war is over if we show the youngsters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
all the attractions that Uncle Sam has to offer."</p>

<p>"There'll be a lot of them come over anyway so
they might as well learn what they'll see when they
arrive."</p>

<p>"I see heaps of opportunities in that idea," said
Roger. "There's a chance to teach the kiddies
something by these books if we're careful to be
truthful in the pictures we put in."</p>

<p>"Not to make monkeys swinging down the forests
of Broadway, eh?" laughed Tom.</p>

<p>"If I'm to do a million or two of these you'll all
have to help me get the pictures together," begged
James.</p>

<p>"I've brought some with me you can have for a
starter," said Della, "and I'm collecting others
and keeping them in separate envelopes&mdash;animals in
one and buildings in another and so on. It will make
it easier for you."</p>

<p>"<i>Muchas gracias, Se&ntilde;orita</i>," bowed James, who
was just beginning Spanish and liked to air a "Thank
you" occasionally.</p>

<p>"I know what I'm going to make for some member
of my family," declared Roger.</p>

<p>"Name it, it will be such a surprise when it comes."</p>

<p>"Probably it will go to Grandmother Emerson
so I don't mind telling you that I think I'll write a
history of our summer at Chautauqua and illustrate
it."</p>

<p>"That's the best notion that ever came from
Roger," approved James. "I think I'll make one
and give it to Father. The Recognition Day procession
and all that, you know."</p>

<p>"Envelopes make me think that we may have
some small gifts&mdash;cards or handkerchiefs&mdash;that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
can send in envelopes," said Ethel Blue, "and we
ought to decorate them just as much as our boxes."</p>

<p>"They won't be hard. Any of the ideas we've
suggested for the boxes will do&mdash;flowers and silhouettes,
and seals. You're a smarty with watercolors
so you can paint some original figures or a
tiny landscape, but the rest of us will have to keep
to the pastepot," laughed Margaret.</p>

<p>"For home gifts we can write rhymes to put into
the envelopes, but I suppose it wouldn't do for these
European kids," said Tom. "We don't know
where they're going, you see, and it would never do
if an English child got a German rhyme or the other
way round."</p>

<p>"O-oh, ne-<i>ver</i>," gasped Ethel Blue whose quick
imagination sympathized with the feelings of a child
to whom such a thing happened. "We'll have to
make them understand through their eyes."</p>

<p>"Fortunately Santa Claus with his pack speaks a
language they can all understand," nodded Roger.</p>

<p>"Here comes his humble servant right now," exclaimed
Mrs. Hancock at the door.</p>

<p>Tom ran to hold it open for her, and Roger relieved
her of the waiter which she was carrying.</p>

<p>"James has to have an egg-nog at this time," she
explained, "so I thought all of you might like to be
'picked up' after your hard afternoon's work."</p>

<p>These sentiments were greeted with applause
though Tom insisted that the best part of the afternoon
was yet to come as he had not yet had a chance
to tell about his invention.</p>

<p>"One that you'll appreciate tremendously, Mrs.
Hancock," he said gravely. "All housekeepers will.
You must get Margaret to make you one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't tell her what it is and I can give it to her
for Christmas," cried Margaret.</p>

<p>James's egg-nog and his wafers were placed on
the table beside him. The others sat at small tables,
of which there were several around the room, and
drank their egg-nog and ate their cakes with great
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Tell me how this egg-nog is made," begged
Helen. "It is delicious and I'm sure Mother would
like to know."</p>

<p>"Mother always has it made the same way," replied
Margaret. "I'm sure it is concocted out of six
eggs and half a pound of sugar, and three pints of
whipped cream and a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg."</p>

<p>"It's so foamy&mdash;that isn't the whipped cream
alone."</p>

<p>"First you beat the yolks of the eggs and the
sugar together until it is all frothy. Then you beat
the whites of the eggs by themselves until they are
stiff and you stir that in gently. Then you put the
spice on top of that and lastly you heap the whipped
cream on top of the whole thing."</p>

<p>"It's perfectly delicious," exclaimed Dorothy,
"and so is the fruit cake."</p>

<p>"Mother prides herself on her fruit cake. It is
good, isn't it? She's going to let me make some to
send to the orphans."</p>

<p>"Won't that be great. Baked in ducky little pans
like these."</p>

<p>"They'll keep perfectly, of course."</p>

<p>"Would your mother let us have the receipt now
so we could be practicing it to make some too?"
asked Dorothy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sure she'd be delighted," and Margaret ran
off to get her mother's manuscript cook book from
which Dorothy copied the following receipt:</p>

the mixture. Add the extract. Stir and beat well.
Fill greased pans two-thirds full. Bake in a moderately
hot oven one and a quarter hours if in a loaf.
In small sizes bake slowly twenty to thirty minutes."</p>

<p>"I'm ready to hear what Tom's got to offer," said
James, leaning back luxuriously in his chair after the
remains of the feast had been taken away.</p>

<p>"Mine is a paper-cutting scheme," responded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Tom. "Perhaps it won't come easy to everybody,
but on a small scale I'm something of a paper cutter
myself."</p>

<p>"Dull edged?" queried Roger.</p>

<p>"Hm," acknowledged Tom. "I can't illustrate
'Cinderella' like the man Della saw, but I can cut
simple figures and I want to propose one arrangement
of them to this august body."</p>

<p>"Fire ahead," came Roger's permission.</p>

<p>"It's just a variation of the
strings of paper dolls that I used
to make for Della when she was
a year or two younger than she is
now."</p>

<p>Della received this taunt with a
puckered face.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 153px;">
<img src="images/p158.jpg" width="153" height="300" alt="&quot;Fold strips of paper and then cut one figure of a little girl&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Fold strips of paper and then cut one figure of a little girl&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"You fold strips of white paper&mdash;or
blue or yellow or any old
color&mdash;in halves and then in halves
again and then again, until it is
about three inches wide. Then
you cut one figure of a little girl,
letting the tips of the hands and
skirts remain uncut. When you
unfold the strip you have a string
of cutey little girls joining hands. See?"</p>

<p>They all laughed for all of them had cut just such
figures when they were children.</p>

<p>"Now my application of this simple device," went
on Tom in the solemn tones of a professor, "is to
make them serve as lamp shades."</p>

<p>"For the orphans?" laughed Roger.</p>

<p>"For the orphans I'm going to cut about a bushel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of strips of all colors. Children always like to play
with them just so."</p>

<p>"I don't see why those of us who can't draw
couldn't cut a child or a dog or some figure from a
magazine and lay it on the folded paper and trace
around the edges and then cut it," suggested Dorothy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/p159.jpg" width="450" height="198" alt="A String of Paper Dolls" title="" />
<span class="caption">A String of Paper Dolls</span>
</div>

<p>"You could perfectly well. All you have to remember
is to leave a folded edge at the side, top and
bottom. You can make a row of dogs standing on
their hind paws and holding hands&mdash;forepaws&mdash;and
the ground they are standing on will fasten them together
at the bottom."</p>

<p>"How does the lamp shade idea work out?" asked
Helen with Grandfather Emerson's Christmas gift
in mind.</p>

<p>"You cut a string of figures that are fairly straight
up and down, like Greek maidens or some conventional
vases or a dance of clowns. Then you must
be sure that your strip is long enough to go around
your shade. Then you line it with asbestos paper&mdash;the
kind that comes in a sort of book for the
kitchen."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see. You paste the strip right on to the asbestos
paper and cut out the figures," guessed James.</p>

<p>"Exactly," replied Tom. "After which you paste
the ends of the strip together and there you have
your shade ready to slip on to the glass."</p>

<span class="caption">Photograph Frame&mdash;front</span>
</div>

<p>"What keeps it from falling down and off?"</p>

<p>"The shape of the shade usually holds it up. If
it isn't the right shape, though, you can run a cord
through your figures' hands and tighten them up as
much as you need to."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think that's a rather jolly stunt of Tom's,"
commended Roger patronizingly. Tom gave him a
kick under the table and James growled a request
not to hit his game leg.</p>

<p>"If you boys are beginning to quarrel it's time we
adjourned," decided the president. "Has anybody
any more ideas to get off her alleged mind this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"I thought of picture frames," offered James.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"While my hand is in with pasting I believe I'll
make some frames&mdash;a solid pasteboard back and the
front with an oval or an oblong or a square cut out
of it. You paste the front on to the back at the
edges except at the bottom. You leave that open to
put the picture in."</p>

<p>"You can cover that with chintz&mdash;cotton, cotton,
cotton," chanted Dorothy, who seldom missed a
chance to promote the cotton crusade.</p>

<p>"How do you hang it up?" asked Margaret.</p>

<p>"Stick on a little brass ring with a bit of tape.
Or you can make it stand by putting a stiff bit of
cardboard behind it with a tape hinge."</p>

<p>"That would be a good home present," said Ethel
Brown.</p>

<p>"Perfectly good for family photographs. You
can make them hold two or three. But you can fix
them up for the European kids and put in any sort
of picture&mdash;a dog or a cat or George Washington
or some really beautiful picture."</p>

<p>"I believe in giving them pictures of America or
American objects or places or people," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Dorothy is the champion patriot of the United
Service Club," laughed Roger. "Come on, infants;
we must let James rest or Mrs. Hancock won't invite
us to come again. I wish you could get over to
Rosemont for the movies next week," he added.</p>

<p>"What movies?"</p>

<p>"The churches have clubbed together and hired
the school hall and they're going to get the latest
moving pictures from the war zone that they can
find. It is the first time Rosemont has ever had the
real thing."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PREVENTION</div>


<div class='cap'>THE Mortons were gathered about the fire in
the half hour of the day which they especially
enjoyed. Mrs. Morton made a point of being at
home herself for this time, and she liked to have all
the young people meet her in the dusk and tell her
of the day's work and play. It was a time when
every one was glad to rest for a few minutes after
dressing for dinner.</div>

<p>"I'm sure to get my hair mussed up if I do anything
but talk to Mother after I brush it for dinner,"
Roger was in the habit of explaining, "so it suits me
just to stare at the fire."</p>

<p>He was sitting now on the floor beside her with
his head leaning against the arm of her chair.
Dicky was occupying the Morris chair with her, and
the three girls were in comfortable positions, the
Ethels on the sofa and Helen knitting a scarf as she
sat on a footstool before the blaze.</p>

<p>"You're not trying your eyes knitting in this imperfect
light?" asked her mother.</p>

<p>"This is plain sailing, Mother. I can rush along
on this straight piece almost as fast as Mrs. Hindenburg,
and I don't have to look on at all unless a
horrid fear seizes me that I've skipped a stitch."</p>

<p>"Which I hope you haven't done."</p>

<p>"Never really but there have been several false
alarms."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"How is Fr&auml;ulein?"</p>

<p>"All right, I guess."</p>

<p>"Did you see her to-day?"</p>

<p>"We had German compo to-day. I didn't do
much with it."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It didn't seem to go off well. I don't know why.
Perhaps I didn't try as hard as usual."</p>

<p>"Did it disturb Fr&auml;ulein?"</p>

<p>"Did what disturb Fr&auml;ulein?"</p>

<p>"That you didn't do your lesson well."</p>

<p>"Disturb Fr&auml;ulein? I don't know. Why should
it disturb her? I should think I was the one to be
disturbed."</p>

<p>"Were you?"</p>

<p>"Was I disturbed? Well, no, Mother, to tell the
truth I didn't care much. That old German is so
hard and the words all break up so foolishly&mdash;somehow
it didn't seem very important to me this morning.
And Fanny Shrewsbury said something awfully
funny about it under her breath and we got
laughing and&mdash;no, I wasn't especially disturbed."</p>

<p>"Although you had a poor lesson and didn't try
to make up for it by paying strict attention in the
class!"</p>

<p>"Why, Mother, I, er&mdash;"</p>

<p>Helen stopped knitting.</p>

<p>"You think I'm taking too seriously a poor lesson
that wasn't very bad, after all? Possibly I am, but
I've been noticing that all of you are more careless
lately than I want my girls and boys to be."</p>

<p>Mrs. Morton stroked Roger's hair and looked
around at the handsome young faces illuminated by
the firelight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean us, too?" cried the Ethels, sitting up
straight upon the sofa.</p>

<p>"You, too."</p>

<p>"We haven't meant to be careless, Mother," said
Roger soberly. His mother's good opinion was
something he was proud of keeping and she was so
fair in her judgments that he felt that he must meet
any accusations like the present in the honest spirit
in which they were made.</p>

<p>"Do you want to know what I think is the trouble
with all of you?"</p>

<p>Every one of them cried out for information, even
Dicky, whose "Yeth" rang out above the others.</p>

<p>"If you ask for my candid opinion," responded
Mrs. Morton, "I think you are giving so much time
and attention to the work of the U. S. C. that you
aren't paying proper attention to the small matters
of every day life that we must all meet."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Mother, you approve of the U. S. C."</p>

<p>"Certainly I approve of it. I think it is fine in
every way; but I don't believe in your becoming so
absorbed in it that you forget your daily duties.
Aunt Louise had to telephone to Roger to go over
and start her furnace for her yesterday when the
sharp snap came, and the Ethels have been rushing
off in the morning without doing the small things to
help Mary that are a part of their day's work."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother, they're such little things! She can
do them easily once in a while."</p>

<p>"Any one of your morning tasks is a small matter,
but when none of them are done they mount up to a
good deal for Mary. If there were some real necessity
for making an extra bed Mary would do it
without complaining, but when, as happened yesterday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
morning, neither of you Ethels made your bed,
and Roger left towels thrown all over his floor, and
not one of Helen's bureau drawers was shut tight,
and Dicky upset a box of beads and went off to kindergarten
without picking them up&mdash;don't you see
that what meant but a few minutes' work for each
one of you meant an hour's work for one person?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet Mary didn't mind," growled Roger.</p>

<p>"Mary is too loyal to say anything, but if your
present careless habits should continue we should
have to have an extra maid to wait on you, and you
know very well that that is impossible."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Mother," said Roger penitently.
"I'm sorry about the towels and about Aunt Louise
and I'm sorry I growled. You're right, of course."</p>

<p>"I rather guess we've been led astray by being so
successful with our team work in the club," said
Helen thoughtfully. "We've found out that we can
do all sorts of things well if we pull together and
we've been forgetting to apply co-operation at
home."</p>

<p>"Exactly," agreed Mrs. Morton. "And you've
been so absorbed in the needs of people several thousand
miles away that you overlook the needs of people
beside you. What you've been doing to Mary is
unkind; what Helen did to Fr&auml;ulein this morning
was unkind."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother! I wouldn't be unkind to Fr&auml;ulein
for the world."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you would if you thought about
it. She certainly is in such sore trouble that she
needs all the consideration that her scholars can give
her, yet you must have annoyed her greatly this
morning."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid Fr&auml;ulein's used to our not knowing
our lessons very well," observed Roger.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to hear that, but if you know you
aren't doing as well as you ought to with your lessons
that is the best reason in the world for you to
pay the strictest attention while you are in class.
Yet Helen says that she and Fanny Shrewsbury were
laughing. I'm afraid Fr&auml;ulein isn't feeling especially
content with her work this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Mother, you make me feel like a hound dog,"
cried Helen. "And I've been talking as if I were so
sorry for Fr&auml;ulein!"</p>

<p>"You are sorry for her as the heroine of a romance,
because her betrothed is in the army and she
doesn't know where he is or whether he is alive.
It sounds like a story in a book. But when you
think what that would mean if it were you that had
to endure the suffering it wouldn't seem romantic.
Suppose Father were fighting in Mexico and we
hadn't heard from him for a month&mdash;do you think
you could throw off your anxiety for a minute?
Don't you think you'd have to be careful every instant
in school to control yourself? Don't you think
it would be pretty hard if some one in school constantly
did things that irritated you&mdash;didn't know
her lessons and then laughed and giggled all through
the recitation hour?"</p>

<p>Helen's and Roger's heads were bent.</p>

<p>"Imagine," Mrs. Morton went on, "how you
would feel every day when you came home, wondering
all the way whether a letter had come; wondering
whether, if one <i>had</i> come, it would be from
Father or from some one else saying that Father
was&mdash;wounded."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Mother, I can't&mdash;" Helen was almost crying.</p>

<p>"You can't bear to think of it; yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet Fr&auml;ulein was just so anxious and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And we made things worse for her!"</p>

<p>"I know you didn't think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We ought to think. I've excused myself all my
life by saying 'I didn't think.' I ought to think."</p>

<p>"'I didn't think' <i>explains</i>, but it doesn't <i>excuse</i>."</p>

<p>"Nothing excuses meanness."</p>

<p>"That's true."</p>

<p>"And it's almost as mean not to see when people
are in trouble as it is to see it and not to care."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're teaching us to be observant, Aunt
Marion," said Ethel Blue quietly. "I used to think
it was sort of <i>distinguished</i> to be absent-minded and
not to pay attention to people, but now I think it's just
<i>stupidity</i>."</p>

<p>"Mother," said Roger, sitting up straight, "I've
been a beast. Poor Fr&auml;ulein is worrying herself
to pieces every minute of the day and I never
thought anything about it. And I let Aunt Louise
freeze yesterday morning and Dorothy had to go
to school before the house was warmed up and she
had a cold to-day because she got chilled. I see
your point, and I'm a reformed pirate from this
minute!"</p>

<p>Roger rose and squared his shoulders and walked
about the room.</p>

<p>"When you think it out it's little things that are
hard to manage all the time," he went on thoughtfully.
"Here are these little things that we've been
pestering Mary about, and when we kids squabble
it's almost always about some trifle."</p>

<p>"A pin prick is often more trying than a severe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
wound," agreed his mother. "You brace yourself
to bear a real hurt, but it doesn't seem worth while
for a trifle and so you whine about it before you
think. If Father and Uncle Richard really were in
action all of us would do our best to be brave about
it and to bear our trouble uncomplainingly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The way Fr&auml;ulein does," murmured Helen.</p>

<p>"That's the way when you have a sickness," said
Ethel Brown. "When I had the measles you and
Mary said I didn't make much fuss, but every
time I catch cold I'm afraid all of you hear about
it."</p>

<p>"We do," agreed Roger cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I should say, then," remarked Mrs. Morton as
Mary appeared at the door to announce dinner,
"that this club should bear in mind that it is to
serve not only those at a distance but those near
home, and not only to serve people in deepest
trouble but to serve by preventing suffering."</p>

<p>"I get you, Mother dear," said Roger, taking
his father's seat.</p>

<p>"Prevention is a great modern principle that we
don't think enough about," said Mrs. Morton.</p>

<p>"I know what you mean&mdash;fire prevention," exclaimed
Ethel Blue. "Tom Watkins was telling
us the other day about the Fire Prevention parade
they had in New York. There were a lot of engines
and hose wagons and ladder wagons and they
were all covered with cards telling how much wiser
it was to prevent fire than to let it start and then
try to put it out."</p>

<p>"Della saw the parade," said Ethel Brown.
"She told me there were signs that said 'It's cheaper
to put a sprinkler in your factory than to rebuild the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
factory'; and 'One cigarette in a factory may cost
thousands of dollars in repairs.'"</p>

<p>"The doctors have been working to prevent disease,"
said Roger. "James has often told me what
his father is doing to teach people how to avoid
being sick."</p>

<p>"All these clean-up campaigns are really for the
prevention of illness as much as the making of
cleanliness," said Mrs. Morton.</p>

<p>"Everything of that sort educates people, and we
can apply the same methods to our own lives,"
advised Mrs. Morton. "Why can't we have a
household campaign to prevent giving Mary unnecessary
work and to avoid irritating each other?"</p>

<p>"All that can be worked in as part of the duties
of the Service Club," said Ethel Blue.</p>

<p>"Certainly it can. What's the matter, Ethel
Brown?"</p>

<p>Ethel Brown was on the point of tears.</p>

<p>"One of the girls at school gave me an order for
cookies the other day," she said, "and I didn't do
them because we went over to the Hancocks' that
afternoon."</p>

<p>"You got your own punishment there," remarked
Roger. "If you didn't fill the order you didn't
get any pay."</p>

<p>"That wasn't all. She was going to take them
to a cousin of hers who was just getting over the
mumps. She wanted to surprise her. She was awfully
mad because I didn't make them. She said
she had depended on them and she didn't have anything
to take to her cousin."</p>

<p>"There you see it," exclaimed Mrs. Morton.
"It didn't seem much to Ethel Brown not to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
two or three dozen cookies, but in the first place she
broke her promise, and in the next place she caused
real unhappiness to a girl who was depending on
them to give pleasure to her sick cousin."</p>

<p>"You've given us a shake-up we won't forget
soon, Mother," remarked Roger. "There's one
duty I haven't done this week that you haven't mentioned,
but I'm pretty sure you know it so I might
as well bring it into the light myself and say I'm
sorry."</p>

<p>"What is it?" laughed his mother.</p>

<p>"I haven't been over to see Grandfather and
Grandmother Emerson for ten days."</p>

<p>"They'll be sorry."</p>

<p>"I was relying on one of the girls going."</p>

<p>"We haven't been," confessed the Ethels.</p>

<p>"Nor I," admitted Helen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morton looked serious.</p>

<p>"We love to go there," said Ethel Brown, "but
we've been so busy."</p>

<p>"Too busy to be kind to the people near at hand,
eh?"</p>

<p>The young people looked ruefully at one another.</p>

<p>"Anyway, watch me be attentive to Fr&auml;ulein,"
promised Helen.</p>

<p>She was. She and Roger made a point of giving
her as little trouble as possible; and of paying her
unobtrusive attentions. Roger carried home for
her a huge bundle of exercises; the Ethels left some
chestnuts at her door when they came back from a
hunt on the hillside, and even Dicky wove her a mat
at kindergarten of red and white and black paper&mdash;the
German colors.</p>

<p>The Mortons were all attention to James, too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Every day they remembered to call him up on the
telephone and ask him how his box-making was coming
on. He had a telephone extension on the table
at his elbow and these daily talks cheered him
greatly. The others were leaving the making of
most of the pasted articles to him, and they were
going on with the manufacture of baskets and
leather and brass and copper articles and of odds
and ends of various kinds.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'll be able to get up to Dorothy's next
Saturday," James phoned to Roger one day, "if
Mrs. Smith wouldn't mind the Club meeting downstairs.
I suppose the Pater wouldn't let me try to
climb to the attic yet."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith was delighted to make the change for
James's benefit, but before the day came he called
up Roger one afternoon in great excitement.</p>

<p>"When did you say those church movies were?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"To-morrow evening."</p>

<p>"Father says he'll take me over if he doesn't have
a hurry call at the last minute."</p>

<p>Roger gave a whoop that resounded along the
wire.</p>

<p>"You'll find the whole Club drawn up at the door
of the schoolhouse to meet you," he cried. "The
Watkinses are coming out from New York. Will
Margaret come with you?"</p>

<p>"She and Mother will go over in the trolley."</p>

<p>As Roger had promised, the Club was drawn up
in double ranks before the door when Doctor Hancock
stopped his machine close to the step. Roger
and Tom ran down to make a chair on which to
carry James inside, and Helen and Dorothy were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
ready with the wheel-chair belonging to the old lady
at the Home who had been glad to lend it for the
evening to the boy whose acquaintance she had made
at the Club entertainment.</p>

<p>James was rather embarrassed at being so conspicuous,
but all his Rosemont acquaintances came
to speak to him and he was quite the hero of the occasion.</p>

<p>The moving pictures were an innovation in Rosemont.
There had been various picture shows in
empty stores in the town and they had not all been
of a character approved by the parents of the school
children who went to them in great numbers. The
rooms were dark and there was danger of fire and
the pictures themselves were not always suitable for
young people to see or agreeable for their elders.
The result of a conference among some of the
townspeople who had the interests of the place at
heart was this entertainment which was the first of
a series to be given in the school hall on Friday
evenings all through the winter. The films were
chosen by a sub-committee and it was hoped that they
would be so liked that the poor places down town
would find it unprofitable to continue.</p>

<p>The program was pleasantly varied. The story
of a country boy who went to New York to make his
fortune and who found out that, as in the Oriental
story, his fortune lay buried in his own dooryard&mdash;in
this case in the printing office of his own town&mdash;was
the opener.</p>

<p>That was followed by a remarkable film showing
the habits of swallows and by another whereon some
of the flowers of Burbank's garden waved softly in
the California breeze.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>A dramatization of Daudet's famous story called
"The Last Class" brought tears to the eyes of the
onlookers whose thoughts were much across the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>It was a simple, touching tale, and it served appropriately
as the forerunner of the war pictures that
had just been sent to America by photographers in
Germany and France and Belgium.</p>

<p>The first showed troops leaving Berlin, flags flying,
bands playing, while the crowds along the street
waved a cheerful parting, though once in a while a
woman bent her head behind her neighbor's shoulder
to hide her tears.</p>

<p>There were scenes in Belgium&mdash;houses shattered
by the bombs of airmen, huge holes dug by exploding
shells; wounded soldiers making their way toward
the hospitals, those with bandaged heads and
arms helping those whose staggering feet could
hardly carry them.</p>

<p>It was a serious crowd that followed every movement
that passed on the screen before their eyes.
The silence was deep.</p>

<p>Then came a hospital scene. Rows upon rows
of beds ran from the front of the picture almost out
of sight. Down the space between them came the
doctors, instruments in hand, and behind them the
nurses, the red crosses gleaming on their arm bands.</p>

<p>A stir went through the onlookers.</p>

<p>"It looks like her."</p>

<p>"I believe it is."</p>

<p>"Don't you think so? The one on the right?"</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;it's Mademoiselle Millerand!" cried
Roger clearly.</p>

<p>The operator, hearing the noise in front of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
booth, and all unconscious that he was showing a
friend to these townspeople where the pretty young
French teacher had lived for two years, almost
stopped turning his machine. So slowly it went that
there was no doubt among any who had known her.
She followed the physician to the bed nearest the
front. There they stopped and the doctor turned
to Mademoiselle and asked some question. She
was ready with bandages. An orderly slipped his
arm under the soldier's pillow and raised his head.
His eyes were closed and his face was deathly white.
The doctor shook his head. Evidently he would
not attempt an operation upon so ill a man. He
signed to the attendant to lay the man down and as
he did so the people in Rosemont, far, far away
from the Belgian hospital, heard a piercing shriek.</p>

<p>"<i>Mein Verlobt!</i> My betrothed!" screamed
Fr&auml;ulein Hindenburg.</p>

<p>"That's Schuler."</p>

<p>"Don't you recognize Schuler?"</p>

<p>"No wonder poor Fr&auml;ulein screamed!"</p>

<p>Kind hands were helping Fr&auml;ulein and her mother
from the hall. Doctor Hancock went out with them
to give a restorative to the young woman and to
take them home in his car.</p>

<p>"Didn't he die at that very moment, Herr Doctor?"
whispered Fr&auml;ulein, and the doctor was
obliged to confess that it seemed so.</p>

<p>"But we can't be sure," he insisted.</p>

<p>Fr&auml;ulein's agitation put an end to the entertainment
for that evening. Indeed, the film was almost
exhausted when the bitter sight came to her. The
people filed out seriously.</p>

<p>"If that poor girl has been in doubt about her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
betrothed, now she knows," one said to another.</p>

<p>"Do you think he really died?" James asked his
father as they were driving home.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he did, son. But there is just a chance
that he didn't because the film changed just there
to another scene so you couldn't tell."</p>

<p>"That might have been because they didn't want
to show a death scene."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it was."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FOR SANTA CLAUS'S PACK</div>


<div class='cap'>JAMES telephoned Dorothy that he was going to
be at her house on the afternoon of the Club
meeting if it was going to be downstairs and Dorothy
replied that her mother was very glad to let
them have the dining room to work in. All the
members had arrived when Doctor Hancock stopped
his car at the door and Margaret got out and rang
the bell for Roger's and Tom's help in getting James
into the house. Everybody hailed him with pleasure
and everybody's tongue began at once to chatter
about the dramatic happening of the evening before.</div>

<p>"I'm perfectly crazy to hear everything you've
learned this morning," said Margaret, "but before
we start talking about it I want to make a beginning
on a basket so I can be working while I listen."</p>

<p>"Me, too," said James. "I've pasted enough
boxes and gimcracks to fill a young cottage. In fact
they are now packed in a young cottage that Father
is going to bring over some day when he hasn't
any other load. He said the car wouldn't hold it
and Margaret and him and me all at the same time
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"We've been making all sorts of things this week,"
said Ethel Brown. "I'm just finishing the last of a
dozen balls that I've been covering with crochet.
It's the simplest thing in the world and they're fine
for little children because the slippery rubber balls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
slide out of their fingers and these are just rough
enough for their tiny paws to cling to."</p>

<p>"I've been making those twin bed-time dolls," said
Ethel Blue. "You've seen them in all the shops&mdash;just
ugly dolls of worsted&mdash;but mine are made like
the Danish <i>Nisse</i>, the elves that the Danes use to
decorate their Yuletide trees."</p>

<p>She held up a handful of wee dolls made of white
worsted, doubled until the little figure was about a
finger long. A few strands on each side were cut
shorter than the rest and stood out as arms. A
red thread tied a little way from the top indicated
the neck; another about the middle defined the waist;
the lower part was divided and each leg was tied at
the ankle with red thread, and a red thread bound
the wrists. On the head a peaked red hat of flannel
or of crochet shaded a face wherein two black
stitches represented the eyes, a third the nose, and
a red dot the ruby lips. From the back of the neck
a crocheted cord about eighteen inches long connected
one elf with his twin.</p>

<p>"What's the idea of two?" inquired Tom.</p>

<p>"To keep each other company. You tie them on
to a wire of the baby's crib and they won't get lost."</p>

<p>"Or on to the perambulator."</p>

<p>"They don't take long to make&mdash;see, I wind the
wool over my fingers, so, to get the right length,
and then I tie them as quick as a wink; and when I
feel in the mood of making the caps I turn off a
dozen or two of them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the cord by the yard, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Just about. I've made quantities of these this
week and I'm not going to make any more, so I'll
help with the baskets or the stenciling."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've been jig-sawing," said Roger. "I've made
jumping jacks till you can't rest."</p>

<p>"Where did you get your pattern?" asked Tom
who also was a jig sawyer.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 378px;">
<img src="images/p179.jpg" width="378" height="400" alt="Jumping Jack" title="" />
<span class="caption">Jumping Jack</span>
</div>

<p>"I took an old one of Dicky's that was on the
downward road and pulled it to pieces so that I could
use each part for a pattern. I cut out ever so many
of each section. Then I spent one afternoon painting
legs and arms and jackets and caps, and Ethel
Blue painted the faces for me. I'm not much on
expression except my own, you know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you put them together yet?"</p>

<p>"Dorothy has been tying the pull strings for me
this afternoon and I'm going to do the glueing now
while you people are learning baskets."</p>

<p>"James ought to do the glueing for you," suggested
Margaret in spite of James's protesting gestures.</p>

<p>Roger laughed.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be so mean as to ask him," he said.
"He's stuck up enough for one lifetime, I suspect."</p>

<p>"I've been jigging, too," confessed Tom.</p>

<p>"Anything pretty?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"Of course something pretty," defended Helen.
"Don't you remember the beauty box he made Margaret?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do. Its delicate openwork surpassed
any of my humble efforts."</p>

<p>"It was pretty, wasn't it?" murmured Margaret.
"The yellow silk lining showed through."</p>

<p>"What I've been doing lately was the very simplest
possible toy for the orphans." Tom disclaimed
any fine work. "I've just been cutting circles
out of cigar boxes and punching two holes side
by side in each one. Then I run a string through
the two holes. You slip it over your forefinger of
each hand and whirl the disk around the string until
it is wound up tight and then by pulling the string you
keep the whirligig going indefinitely."</p>

<p>"It doesn't look like much of a toy to me," said
Della crushingly.</p>

<p>"May be not, ma'am, but I tried it on Dad and
Edward and they played with it for ten minutes
apiece. You find yourself pulling it in time to some
air you're humming in the back of your head."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Right-o," agreed James. "I had a tin one once
and I played with it from morning till night. I believe
the orphans will spend most of their waking
hours tweaking those cords."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you think so," said Tom. "Roger was
so emphatic I was afraid I'd been wasting my
time."</p>

<p>"What's Dorothy been up to this week?" asked
James.</p>

<p>"Dorothy couldn't make up her mind whether she
wanted most to make bags or model clay candlesticks
or dress dolls this week," responded Dorothy,
"but she finally decided to dress dolls."</p>

<p>"Where did you get the dolls?"</p>

<p>"Some of them I got with treasury money&mdash;they're
real dolls, and I made galoptious frocks for
them out of scraps from piece-bags."</p>

<p>"Were you patient enough to make all the clothes
to take off?" asked Della.</p>

<p>"Every identical garment," replied Dorothy emphatically.
"Dolls aren't any fun unless you can
dress and undress them. I never cared a rap for a
doll with its clothes fastened on."</p>

<p>"Nor I."</p>

<p>"Nor I."</p>

<p>"Nor I."</p>

<p>Every girl in the room agreed with this opinion.</p>

<p>"The rag dolls are the ones I believe the children
will like best," said Helen; "that is, if they are at
all like American children."</p>

<p>"Isn't it funny&mdash;I always liked that terrible looking
old rag object of mine better than the prettiest
one Father ever sent me," agreed Ethel Blue.</p>

<p>"Every child does," said Margaret.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dorothy made some fine ones," complimented
Helen.</p>

<p>"Did you draw them or did you get the ones that
are already printed on cloth?" asked Della.</p>

<p>"Both. The printed ones are a great deal prettier
than mine, but Aunt Marion had a stout piece
of cotton cloth&mdash;"</p>

<p>A shout arose.</p>

<p>"Cotton cloth! That's enough to interest Dorothy
in making anything," laughed Tom.</p>

<p>"Almost," agreed Dorothy good-naturedly.
"Any way, I used up the piece of cloth making dolls
and cats and dogs. I drew them on the cloth and
then stitched them on the machine and, I tell you,
I remembered the time when Dicky's stuffed cat had
an awful accident and lost almost all his inner
thoughts, and I sewed every one of the little beasties
twice around."</p>

<p>"What did you stuff them with?"</p>

<p>"Some with cotton."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Ha!" retorted Dorothy, "and some with rags,
and one with sawdust, but I didn't care for him;
he was lumpy."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you could paint well enough to
color them," said Roger.</p>

<p>"I can't. I did a few but Ethel Blue did the
best one. There was a cat that was so fierce that
Aunt Marion's cat growled at it. He was a winner!"</p>

<p>"All the rag dolls were dressed in cotton dresses,"
explained Ethel Brown.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"But the real dolls were positively scrumptious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
There was a bride, and a girl in a khaki sport suit,
and a boy in a sailor suit, and a baby. They were
regular beauties."</p>

<p>All the time that these descriptions had been given
Dorothy and the Mortons had been opening packages
of rattan and raffia and laying them out on the
dining table. James sat in state at one end, his
convalescent leg raised on a chair, and his right
hand to the table so that he could handle his materials
easily.</p>

<p>"I'm simply perishing to hear about Fr&auml;ulein,"
he acknowledged. "Do start me on this basket
business, Dorothy, so I can hear about her."</p>

<p>"We don't know such an awful lot," said Dorothy
slowly as she counted out the spokes for a small
basket. "In fact, we don't know anything at all."</p>

<p>"Misery! And my curiosity has been actually
on the boil! How many of those sticks do I need?"</p>

<p>"Let's all do the same basket," suggested Ethel
Brown. "Then one lecture by Miss Dorothy Smith
will do for all of us."</p>

<p>"Doesn't anybody else know how to make them?"</p>

<p>"Della and I do," replied Ethel Blue. "We're
going to work on raffia, but you people might just
as well all do one kind of basket. We can use any
number of them, you know, so it doesn't make any
difference if they are all alike."</p>

<p>"We'll start with a basket that measures three
inches across the bottom and is two and a half inches
deep," announced Dorothy, who was an expert basket
maker. "You'll need eight spokes sixteen inches
long and one nine inches long."</p>

<p>There was a general cutting and counting of rattan
spokes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you ready? Take your knife and in four
rattans make slits long enough to poke the other
four rattans through."</p>

<p>"They're rather fat to get through," complained
James.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;You&#39;ll need eight spokes sixteen inches long and one nine inches long&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Sharpen them to a point. Have you put them
through so they make a cross with the arms of even
length? Then put the single short piece through
on one arm&mdash;no, not way through, James; just far
enough to catch it."</p>

<p>"That's pretty solid just as it is," commented
Tom with his head on one side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nevertheless, you must wrap it with a piece of
raffia. Watch me; lay your raffia at the left side
of the upright arm and bring it across from left to
right. Now pass it under the right hand arm and
over the bottom arm and under the left hand arm.
Instead of covering the wrapping you've just done
you turn back and let your bit of raffia go <i>over</i> the
left hand arm."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/p185.jpg" width="350" height="279" alt="&quot;This weaving process makes the spokes stand out like wheel spokes&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;This weaving process makes the spokes stand out like wheel spokes&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"That binds down the beginning end of the raffia,"
cried Helen.</p>

<p>"Exactly. That's why you do it. Go under the
bottom arm and over the right hand arm behind the
top arm."</p>

<p>"Back at the station the train started from," announced
Margaret.</p>

<p>"So far you've used your weaver&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's that? The raffia?"</p>

<p>"Yes. So far you've used it merely to fasten the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
centre firmly. Now you really begin to weave under
and over the spokes, round and round."</p>

<p>"I could shoot beans through mine," announced
James.</p>

<p>"You haven't pulled your weaver tight as you
wove. Push it down hard toward the centre.
That's it. See how firm that is? You could hardly
get water through that&mdash;much less beans or hound
puppies, as they say in some parts of North Carolina."</p>

<p>"This weaving process makes the spokes stand
out like wheel spokes, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"That's why they're called spokes. By the time
you've been round three times they ought all to be
standing apart evenly."</p>

<p>"Please, ma'am, my raffia is giving out," grumbled
Tom.</p>

<p>"It's time to use a rattan weaver, then. You used
raffia at first because the spokes were so near together.
Now you use a fine rattan, finer than your
spokes. Wet it first. Then catch it behind a spoke
and hold on to it carefully until you come to the second
time round or it will slip away from you.
You're all right as soon as the second row holds the
first row in place."</p>

<p>"My rattan weaver is giving out," said Ethel
Brown.</p>

<p>"Take another one and lap it over the end of the
one that is on the point of death, then go right ahead.
If they're too fat at the ends shave them down a
bit where they lap."</p>

<p>"This superb creation of mine is three inches
across the middle," announced James.</p>

<p>"It's time to turn up the spokes then. Make up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
your mind how sharply you want the basket to flare
and watch it as you weave, or you'll have it uneven."</p>

<p>"Mine seems to have reached a good height for
a small work basket," decided Helen, her head on
one side.</p>

<p>"Mine isn't quite so high, but I can seem to see
a few choice candies of Ethel Brown's concoction
resting happily within its walls," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Let's all make the border. Measure the spokes
and cut them just three inches beyond the top of the
weaving. You'll have to sharpen their tips a little
or else you'll have trouble pushing them down among
the weavers."</p>

<p>"I get the idea! You bend them into scallops!"</p>

<p>"Wet them first or there'll be broken fence pickets.
When you've soaked them until they're pliable
enough bend each spoke over to make a scallop and
thrust it down right beside its neighbor spoke between
the weavers."</p>

<p>"Mine is more than ever a work basket," said
Helen when she had completed the edge. "I shall
line it with brown and fit it up with a thimble and
threads and needles and a tiny pair of scissors."</p>

<p>"Mine, too," was Ethel Brown's decision.</p>

<p>"My sides turn up too sharply," James thought.
"I shall call mine a cover for a small flower pot.
Then I shan't have to line it!"</p>

<p>"Here are some of the most easily made mats and
baskets in the world," announced Della. "They're
made just like the braided rugs you find in farm
houses in New England. Mother got some in New
Hampshire once before we started going to Chautauqua
for the summers."</p>

<p>"I've seen them," said Margaret. "There are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
yards and yards of rags cut all the same width and
sewed together and then they are braided and then
the braid is sewed round and round."</p>

<p>"You make raffia mats or baskets in just the same
way, only you sew them with raffia," explained Della.
"You braid the raffia first
and that gives you an opportunity
to make pretty
color combinations."</p>

<p>"A strand of raffia
doesn't last forever. How
do you splice it?"</p>

<p>"Splice a thick end
alongside of a thin end
and go ahead. Try to
pick out strands of different
lengths for your plaiting
or they'll all run out
at once and have to be
spliced at once and it may
make them bunchy if you
aren't awfully careful."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 216px;">
<img src="images/p188.jpg" width="216" height="400" alt="The braid for easily made rugs and baskets" title="" />
<span class="caption">The braid for easily made rugs and baskets</span>
</div>

<p>"I saw a beauty basket
once made of corn husks
braided in the same way.
The inside husks are a
delicate color you know, and they were split into
narrow widths and plaited into a long rope."</p>

<p>"Where the long leaf pine grows," said Dorothy,
"they use pine needles in the same way, only they
wrap them around with thread&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cotton thread?"</p>

<p>"Cotton thread&mdash;of about the same color."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can work sweet grass just so, except that you
can wrap that with a piece of itself."</p>

<p>"When you have enough material," went on Della,
"you begin the sewing. If you're going to make a
round or an oblong mat you decide which right at
the beginning and coil the centre accordingly. Then
all you have to do is to go ahead. Don't let the
stitches show and sew on until the mat is big
enough."</p>

<p>"And for a basket I suppose you pile the braids
upon each other when you've made the bottom the
size you want it."</p>

<p>"Exactly. And you can make the sides flare
sharply or slightly just as we made them do with the
rattan."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with making baskets of
braided cr&ecirc;pe paper?" asked James. "My whole
being has been wrapped in paper for a week so it
may influence my inventive powers unduly, but I
really don't see why it shouldn't work."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to take you off your perch," remarked
Ethel Brown, "but I've seen one."</p>

<p>"O&mdash;oh!" wailed James in disappointment.
"They were pretty though, weren't they?"</p>

<p>"They were beauties. There was a lovely color
combination in the one I saw."</p>

<p>"You could make patriotic ones for Fourth of
July&mdash;red, white, and blue."</p>

<p>"Or green and red ones for Christmas."</p>

<p>"Or all white for Easter."</p>

<p>"Or pinky ones for May Day."</p>

<p>Just at this moment there came a rush of small
feet and Dicky burst into the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hullo," he exclaimed briefly.</p>

<p>"Hullo," cried a chorus in return.</p>

<p>"I've seen her," said Dicky.</p>

<p>"Who is 'her'?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"Fr&auml;ulein."</p>

<p>"Fr&auml;ulein! Dicky, what have you been doing?"</p>

<p>Helen seized him by the arm and drew him to the
side of her chair, while all the other members of
the Club laid down their work and listened.</p>

<p>Dicky was somewhat embarrassed at being the object
of such undivided attention. He climbed up
into Helen's lap.</p>

<p>"I heard you talking at breakfatht about Fr&auml;ulein
and how thomebody perhapth wath dead and perhapth
wathn't dead, tho I went and athked her if
he wath dead."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dicky!"</p>

<p>Helen buried her face in his bobbed hair, and the
rest of the Mortons looked at each other aghast.</p>

<p>"We were wondering if it would be an intrusion
to send Fr&auml;ulein some flowers," explained Helen,&mdash;"and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and here Dicky butts right in!" finished Roger.</p>

<p>"I went to the houthe and I rang the bell," continued
Dicky, "and an old lady came to the door."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hindenburg."</p>

<p>"I thaid 'Ith Mith Fr&auml;ulein at home?' The old
lady thaid 'Yeth.' I walked in and there wath Mith
Fr&auml;ulein in front of the fire. I thaid, 'Ith he
dead?'"</p>

<p>"You asked her?"</p>

<p>"Great Scott!"</p>

<p>"Fr&auml;ulein thaid, 'I don't know, Dicky.' And I
thaid, 'Here ith a chethnut I found. You can have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
it.' And Fr&auml;ulein thaid, 'Thank you, Dicky,' and
I that on her lap and the talked to me a long time
about the man that perhapth ith dead, and thometimeth
the thaid queer wordth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"German," interpreted Margaret under her
breath.</p>

<p>"And onthe the cried a little, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dicky, Dicky, what have you done!"</p>

<p>"I ain't done anything bad, 'coth when I thaid,
'Now I mutht go,' the old lady thaid, 'Thank you
for coming.'"</p>

<p>"She did?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it did Fr&auml;ulein good to cry. Poor
Fr&auml;ulein!"</p>

<p>"I'm going again."</p>

<p>"Did she ask you?"</p>

<p>"Of courth the athked me. And I thaid I'd go
if the'd wear a white dreth. I don't like a black
dreth."</p>

<p>Silence reigned about the table.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew whether he's done harm or good,"
sighed Helen.</p>

<p>"Good, I should say, or Fr&auml;ulein's mother
wouldn't have asked him to come again," said Ethel
Blue.</p>

<p>"At this uncertain moment I think we'd better
have some refreshments," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I'm certainly in need of something sustaining,"
groaned Roger.</p>

<p>"Then try these sugar cookies of Ethel Brown's."</p>

<p>"Let me write down right now how she makes
them," exclaimed Della, borrowing a pencil from
Tom. "This is the kind you're going to make for
the orphans, isn't it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, they'll keep a long time, especially if they're
wrapped in paraffin paper and put into a tin."</p>

<p>"Recite the rule to me."</p>

<p>"I never can remember rules. Dorothy's got it
copied into her cook book. Ask her for it."</p>

<p>"Here you are," said Dorothy who had overheard
the conversation, "here on page twenty. And I
know you're going to ask for the fudge receipt as
soon as you taste Ethel Blue's fudge so you might
as well copy that at the same time. It's on the next
page."</p>

<p>So Della copied diligently while Dorothy brought
in the cookies and fudge in question and Helen and
Roger discussed Dicky's performance under their
breath.</p>

<p>Here is what Della wrote:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CLUB WEAVES, STENCILS AND MODELS CLAY</div>


<div class='cap'>WHETHER Dicky had done something entirely
inexcusable or something wise no one
was able to decide, but everybody agreed that at any
rate it was pleasanter to think that he had brought
poor Fr&auml;ulein some comfort, and that her mother's
thanking him for coming seemed to mean that.
They all felt somewhat shocked and queer.</div>

<p>"I move, Madam President," said Tom, "that
we don't talk about it any more this afternoon. We
don't know and probably we never shall know, and
so we might as well get to work again. Did you
people realize that time is growing short? The
Santa Claus Ship is booked to sail the first week in
November."</p>

<p>"We did and do realize it," said Helen. "I'd
like to know next about these raffia sofa pillows that
Ethel Blue and Della have been making."</p>

<p>"The ones we made are sofa pillows for the orphans'
dolls," explained Ethel Blue, "or they can be
used for pincushions."</p>

<p>"They make thothe at kindergarten," announced
Dicky. "I can make thothe. Mine are paper."</p>

<p>"They're made in just about the same way," said
Della. "We made a small cushion with double
raffia and wove it under and over on a pasteboard
loom."</p>

<p>"How do you make that?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just a piece of heavy pasteboard or a light board
or you can take the frame of a smashed slate. You
fasten the ends of the threads with pins or tacks or
tie them around the bars. First you lay all the
threads you want in one direction. That's the
warp."</p>

<p>"Warp&mdash;I remember. I always have to look it
up in the dictionary to see which is warp and which
is woof."</p>

<p>"Warp is the thread that goes on first. In a rug
or a piece of tapestry it's the plain, ugly thread that
holds the beautifully colored threads in place. It's
the up and down threads. In raffia you have to be
careful to alternate the big ends and small ends so
that the weaving will be even."</p>

<p>"What do you do when the warp is ready?"</p>

<p>"Before you begin to weave you must make a
solid line across the end so that when you run your
first bit of woof across it won't just push right up
to the bar of the loom and then ravel out when you
cut your product off the loom."</p>

<p>"I get the reason for its existence. I should
think you'd make it by tying a string right across the
loom knotting it into each strand of warp as you pass
by."</p>

<p>"That's exactly what you do; and the ends you can
leave flying to join in with the fringe."</p>

<p>"Can we weave now?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead. When you've made the cushion
square, if you want it square, go around the three remaining
sides and tie a break-water, so to speak, so
that the weaving won't ravel out. Trim your fringe
even and there's one side of your pillow."</p>

<p>"One side would be enough for a pincushion."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you want to make a big sofa cushion&mdash;a grown
up one&mdash;you'll have to make a wide plait of raffia&mdash;a
four strand or six strand braid&mdash;or else you'd
never get it done."</p>

<p>"The unbraided would be too delicate. I hate
to make things that wear out before you can get
used to them about the house."</p>

<p>"You'd have to have a bigger loom for something
that size."</p>

<p>"It's no trouble to make. Roger nailed mine together,"
said Ethel Blue.</p>

<p>"Any one want the dimensions?" asked Roger.
"Take two pieces of narrow wood twenty-three
inches long, and nail two other pieces of lighter stuff
each twenty-five inches long on to their tops at the
ends. These bits are raised from the table by the
thickness of the first piece of lumber. See?"</p>

<p>Tom and James, who were examining Ethel Blue's
loom, nodded.</p>

<p>"Then nail slender uprights, ten inches tall, at
each of the four corners and connect them by two
other thin sticks twenty-five inches long, running
just above your first pair of twenty-fives. Do you
get it?"</p>

<p>Again the boys nodded.</p>

<p>"That's all there is to it, and you really don't need
to make that for a plain, smooth plank will do at a
pinch."</p>

<p>"How do you carry your woof across?" asked
Margaret. "Your hand would be in its own way,
I should think."</p>

<p>"You thread the raffia into a wooden bodkin about
twenty-six inches long."</p>

<p>"I can see that you must draw the cross threads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
down tight the way we did in weaving the baskets,"
said James.</p>

<p>"Indeed you must or you'll turn out a sleazy piece
of weaving," answered Della.</p>

<p>"There must be oceans of articles you can make
out of woven raffia."</p>

<p>"Just about everything that you can make out of
a piece of cloth of the same size."</p>

<p>"Of cotton cloth? Ha!"</p>

<p>"Or silk."</p>

<p>"Handkerchief cases and collar cases."</p>

<p>"Coverings for boxes of all kinds. Another material
for James to glue on to pasteboard."</p>

<p>"I see lots of chances for it," he answered seriously.</p>

<p>"I believe old James is really taking kindly to
pasting," laughed Tom.</p>

<p>"Certainly I am. It's a bully occupation," defended
James.</p>

<p>"There are a thousand things that can be made of
raffia&mdash;you can make lace of it like twine lace, and
make articles out of the lace; and you can make
baskets of a combination of rattan and raffia, using
the raffia for wrapping and for sewing. But we
have such a short time left that I think those of us
who are going to do any raffia work had better learn
how to weave evenly and make pretty little duds out
of the woven stuff."</p>

<p>"Wise kid," pronounced Roger. "Now what's
little Margaret going to teach us this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Little Margaret" made a puckered face at this
appellation, but she came promptly to the front.</p>

<p>"Ethel Brown and Dorothy have been teaching
me to stencil. They could teach the rest of you a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
great deal better than I can, but they've done their
share this afternoon so I'll try."</p>

<p>"Go on," urged Ethel Brown. "We'll help you
if you forget."</p>

<p>"If you'll excuse me I'll go to the attic and get
my clay," said Dorothy. "I found a new idea for
a candlestick in a book this morning and I want to
make one before I forget it."</p>

<p>Margaret was in the full swing of explanation
when Dorothy returned.</p>

<p>"Why this frown, fair Coz?" demanded Roger
in a Shakesperean tone.</p>

<p>"It's the queerest thing&mdash;I thought I had enough
clay for two pairs of candlesticks and it seems to
have shrunk or something so there'll only be one
and that mighty small."</p>

<p>"'<i>Mighty small</i>,'" mimicked Roger. "How
large is <i>'mighty</i> small'?"</p>

<p>"Don't bother me, Roger. I'll start this while
Margaret talks."</p>

<p>"When a drawing fit seizes Ethel Blue again we'll
get her to make us some original stencils," said
Helen. "These that we bought at the Chautauqua
art store will do well enough for us to learn with."</p>

<p>"They are very pretty," defended Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Mine won't be any better, only they will be original,"
said Ethel Blue.</p>

<p>"I hate to mention it," said Tom in a whisper,
"but I'm not perfectly sure that I know what a stencil
is."</p>

<p>There was a shout from around the table.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Thomas," soothed Roger, patting
his friend on the shoulder. "Confession is good for
the soul. A stencil, my son, is a thin sheet of something&mdash;pasteboard,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the girls use&mdash;with a pattern cut
out of it. You lay the stencil down on a piece of
cloth or canvas or board or whatever you want to
decorate, and you scrub color on all the part of the
material that shows through."</p>

<p>"Methinks I see a great light," replied Tom, slapping
his forehead. "When you lift the stencil there
is your pattern done in color."</p>

<p>Roger and James leaned forward together and
patted Tom's brow.</p>

<p>"Such it is to have real intellect!" they murmured
in admiring accents.</p>

<p>Tom bowed meekly.</p>

<p>"Enlighten me further&mdash;also these smarties.
What kind of paint do you use?"</p>

<p>"Tapestry dyes or oil paints. It depends somewhat
on your material. If you want to launder it,
use the dye."</p>

<p>"Fast color, eh?"</p>

<p>"When you wash it, set the color by soaking
your article in cold water salted. Then wash it
gently in the suds of white soap. Suds, mind you;
don't touch the cake of soap to it."</p>

<p>"I promise you solemnly I'll never touch a cake
of soap to any stenciling I do."</p>

<p>"You're ridiculous, Roger. No, I believe you
won't!"</p>

<p>"Here's a piece of cloth Ethel Brown is going to
make into a doll's skirt. See, she's hemmed it already
and I'll put this simple star stencil on the
hem. Where's a board, Dorothy?"</p>

<p>Dorothy brought a sewing board and the others
watched Margaret pin her material down hard upon
it and fasten the stencil over that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good girl! You've got them so tight they won't
dare to shiver," declared Tom.</p>

<p>"Do you notice that this stencil has been shellacked
so the edges won't roughen when I scrub?
Stiff bristle brushes are what I'm using." Margaret
called their attention to her utensils. "And I have
a different brush for each color. Also I have an
old rag to dabble the extra color off on to."</p>

<p>"Are you ready? Go!" commanded Roger.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/p200.jpg" width="425" height="164" alt="&quot;I&#39;ll put this simple star stencil on the hem&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;I&#39;ll put this simple star stencil on the hem&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Margaret scrubbed hard and succeeded in getting
a variety of shading through the amount of paint
that she allowed to soak entirely through or partway
through the material. When she had done as
many stars as there were openings on the pattern
she took out the pins and moved the stencil along so
that the holes came over a fresh piece of material,
making sure that the space between the first new
star and the last old one was the same as that between
the stars on the stencil.</p>

<p>"How can we boys apply that?" asked James.</p>

<p>"You can stencil on anything that you would decorate
with painting," said Ethel Brown.</p>

<p>"Your jig-saw disks, Tom. Stencil a small conventional
pattern on each one&mdash;a star or a triangle."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here's a stencil of a vine that would be a beauty
on one of your large plain pasteboard boxes, James."</p>

<p>"Dorothy has been turning white cheesecloth doll
clothes into organdie muslins by stenciling on them
these tiny sprays of roses and cornflowers and jasmine."</p>

<p>"I'm going to do roosters and cats and dogs on a
lot of bibs for the babies."</p>

<p>"You'd better save a few in case Mademoiselle
really sends us that Belgian baby."</p>

<p>"I'll make some more if it does turn up."</p>

<p>"Aunt Marion gave me some cotton flannel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cot&mdash;ton!"</p>

<p>"Cotton flannel, yes, sir; and I've made it into
some little blankets for tiny babies. I bound the
raw edges, and on some of them I did a cross stitch
pattern and on others I stenciled a pattern."</p>

<p>"It saves time, I should say."</p>

<p>"Lots. When you have ever so many articles
gathered, just have a stenciling bee and you can turn
out the decoration much faster than by doing even
a wee bit of embroidery."</p>

<p>"If the Belgian baby really comes, let's make it
a play-house. The boys can do the carpentry and
we can all make the furniture and I'm wild to stencil
some cunning curtains for the windows."</p>

<p>"I'll draw you a fascinating pattern for it."</p>

<p>"There's my candlestick half done," said Dorothy
mournfully, "and I can't finish it. I don't
understand about that clay."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it dried up and blew away."</p>

<p>"It did dry, but I moistened it and kneaded it and
cut it in halves with a wire and put the inside edges
outside and generally patticaked it but I'm sure it's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
not more than a quarter the size it was when I left
it in the attic yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"You seem to have made a great mess on the
floor over there by the window; didn't you slice off
some and put it in that cup?"</p>

<p>"That's my 'slip.' It only took a scrap to make
that. It's about as thick as cream and you use it to
smooth rough places and fill up cracks with. No,
that wouldn't account for much of any of the clay."</p>

<p>"How did you make this thing, anyway?" asked
James turning it about.</p>

<p>"Careful. I took a saucer and put a wet rag in
it and then I made a clay snake and coiled it about
the way you make those coiled baskets, only
I smoothed the clay so you can't see the coils. I
hollowed it on the inside like a saucer. Then I put
another wet rag inside my clay saucer and a china
saucer inside that and turned them all upside down
on my work board, and took off the original china
saucer and smoothed down the coils on the underside
of the clay saucer."</p>

<p>Tom drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"Take one yourself," he suggested. "You'll
need it, you talk so fast."</p>

<p>"It stiffened while Margaret was doing her
stenciling. When it was firm enough to handle I
turned it over again and took out the small china
saucer and smoothed off any marks it had left."</p>

<p>"It's about time to build up the candle holder,
isn't it?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 319px;">
<img src="images/p203.jpg" width="319" height="500" alt="Dorothy&#39;s Candlestick" title="" />
<span class="caption">Dorothy&#39;s Candlestick</span>
</div>

<p>"Did you see me bring in a short candle? I
wrapped it in a wet rag and stood it exactly in the
middle of the clay saucer. Then I roughened the
clay around it and wet the rough part with slip and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
pressed a fresh little snake round the foot of the
candle. The slip makes it stick to the roughening,
so you have to roughen the top of every coil and
moisten it with slip."</p>

<p>"You finished off the top of that part very
smoothly," complimented Helen.</p>

<p>"When it's stiff enough you take out the candle
and smooth the inside. Here's where I'm stumped.
I haven't got enough clay for a handle."</p>

<p>"How do you make the handle?"</p>

<p>"Pat out another snake and make a hoop attached
to the holder and another one rolling up on
to the lip of the saucer."</p>

<p>"As if the serpent were trying to put his tail into
his mouth."</p>

<p>"I shall have to just smooth this over with a soft
brush and wrap it up in a wet cloth until I get some
more clay. If I let it get hard I can't finish it."</p>

<p>"What's that drip, Dorothy?" asked Helen, as a
drop of water fell on the table before her.</p>

<p>They all looked at the ceiling where drops of
water were assembling and beginning to fall with a
soft splash. There was a scramble to get their
work out of the way. Dorothy brought a salad
bowl and placed it where it would catch the water
and then ran to investigate the cause of the trouble.</p>

<p>At a cry from upstairs Helen and the Ethels ran
to her help. Roger went to the foot of the stairs
and called up to inquire if they wanted his assistance.
Evidently they did, for he, too, disappeared.
In a few minutes he re-appeared bearing Dicky in
his arms&mdash;a Dicky sopping wet and much subdued.</p>

<p>"What in the world?" everybody questioned.</p>

<p>"Dorothy's found her clay," said Roger. "Come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
on, old man. Wrap Aunt Louise's tweed coat
around you&mdash;so&mdash;and <i>run</i> so you won't catch cold,"
and the two boys disappeared out of the front door,
Dicky stumbling and struggling with the voluminous
folds of his aunt's garment.</p>

<p>Dorothy and the other girls came down stairs in
a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Do telephone to Aunt Marion's and see if
Mother is there and ask her to come home," Dorothy
begged Helen, while she gathered cloths and pans
and went upstairs again, taking the maid with her.</p>

<p>"What did Dicky do?" asked the others again.</p>

<p>Both Ethels burst into laughter.</p>

<p>"He must have gone up in the attic and found
Dorothy's clay, for he had filled up the waste pipe of
the bath tub&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and turned on the water, I'll bet!" exclaimed
Tom.</p>

<p>"That's just what he did. It looks as if he'd been
trying to float about everything he could find in any
of the bedrooms."</p>

<p>"Probably he had a glorious time until the tub
ran over and he didn't know how to stop it."</p>

<p>"Dicky's a great old man! I judge he didn't
float himself!"</p>

<p>"Now Dorothy can finish her candlestick handle!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ETHEL BLUE AWAITS A CABLE</div>


<div class='cap'>MRS. SMITH begged that the meeting should
not adjourn, and under her direction the
trouble caused by Dicky's entrance into the navy was
soon remedied, although it was evident that the
ceiling of the dining-room would need the attention
of a professional.</div>

<p>Roger soon returned with the news that the
honorary member of the Club had taken no cold,
and every one settled down to work again, even
Dorothy, who rescued enough clay from Dicky's
earthworks to complete the handle of her candlestick.</p>

<p>"I'd like to bring a matter before this meeting,"
said Tom seriously when they were all assembled
and working once more.</p>

<p>"Bring it on," urged the president.</p>

<p>"It isn't a matter belonging to this Club, but if
there isn't any one else to do it it seemed to me&mdash;and
to Father when I spoke to him about it&mdash;that
we might do some good."</p>

<p>"It sounds mysterious. Let's have it," said
James.</p>

<p>"It seemed to me as I thought over those movies
the other night that there was a very good chance
that that man Schuler&mdash;your singing teacher, you
know, Fr&auml;ulein's betrothed&mdash;wasn't dead after all."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"It certainly looked like it&mdash;the way he fell back
against the orderly&mdash;he didn't look alive."</p>

<p>"He didn't&mdash;that's a fact. At the same time the
film made one of those sudden changes right at that
instant."</p>

<p>"Father and I thought that was so a death scene
shouldn't be shown," said James.</p>

<p>"That's possible, but it's also possible that they
thought that was a good dramatic spot to leave that
group of people and go off to another group."</p>

<p>"What's your idea? I don't suppose we could
find out from the film people."</p>

<p>"Probably not. It would be too roundabout to
try to get at their operator in Belgium and very
likely he wouldn't remember if they did get in touch
with him."</p>

<p>"He must be seeing sights like that all the time."</p>

<p>"Brother Edward suggested when he heard us
talking about it that we should send a cable to Mademoiselle
and ask her. She must have known Mr.
Schuler here in the school at Rosemont."</p>

<p>"Certainly she did."</p>

<p>"Then she would have been interested enough
in him to recall what happened when she came across
him in the hospital."</p>

<p>"How could we get a message to her? We don't
know where that hospital was. They don't tell the
names of places even in newspaper messages, you
know. They are headed 'From a town near the
front.'"</p>

<p>"Here's where Edward had a great idea&mdash;that
is, Father thought it was workable. See what you
think of it."</p>

<p>The Club was growing excited. The Ethels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
stopped working to listen, Helen's face flushed with
interest, and the boys leaned across the table to hear
the plan to which Rev. Herbert Watkins had given
his approval. They knew that Tom's father, in his
work among the poor foreigners in New York, often
had to try to hunt up their relatives in Europe so that
this would not be a matter of guesswork with him.</p>

<p>"It's pretty much guesswork in this war time,"
admitted Tom when some one suggested it. "You
can merely send a cable and trust to luck that it will
land somewhere. Here's Edward's idea. He says
that the day we went to see Mademoiselle sail she
told him that she was related to Monsieur Millerand,
the French Minister of War. It was through
her relationship with him that she expected to be
sent where she wanted to go&mdash;that is, to Belgium."</p>

<p>"She was sent there, so her expectation seems to
have had a good foundation."</p>

<p>"That's what makes Edward think that perhaps
we can get in touch with her through the same
means."</p>

<p>"Through Monsieur Millerand?"</p>

<p>"He suggests that we send a cable addressed to
Mademoiselle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Justine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;Millerand in the care of Monsieur Millerand,
Minister of War. We could say 'Is Schuler dead?'
and sign it with some name she'd know in Rosemont.
She'd understand at once that in some way news of
his being in Belgium had reached here."</p>

<p>"It seems awfully uncertain."</p>

<p>"It is uncertain. Even if she got the cable she
might not be able to send a reply. Everything is
uncertain about it. At the same time if we <i>could</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
get an answer it would be a comfort to Fr&auml;ulein even
if the message said he had died."</p>

<p>"I believe that's so. It's not knowing that's hardest
to bear."</p>

<p>"Don't you think Mademoiselle would have sent
word to Fr&auml;ulein if he had died?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe she knew they were engaged.
No one knew until after the war had been going on
for several weeks. If ever she wrote to any one in
Rosemont she might mention having seen him, but I
don't believe it would occur to her to send any special
word to Fr&auml;ulein."</p>

<p>"She might be put under suspicion if she addressed
a letter to any one with a German name even if she
lived in the United States."</p>

<p>"No one but Ethel Blue has had a letter from
Mademoiselle since, she left," said Helen. "We
should have heard of it, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you say to the plan? Can't we
send a cable signed by the 'Secretary of the United
Service Club'?"</p>

<p>"I think it would be a good use to put the Club
money to," approved James, the treasurer.</p>

<p>"If you say so I'll send it when I get back to New
York this afternoon. How shall we word it?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Justine Millerand, Care Monsieur
Millerand, Minister of War, Bordeaux,
France," said Roger, slowly.</p>

<p>"Cut out 'Mademoiselle' and 'Monsieur,'" suggested
Margaret. "We must remember that our
remarks cost about a quarter a word in times of
peace and war prices may be higher."</p>

<p>"Cut out 'of War,'" said Ethel Brown.</p>

<p>"There's only one 'Bordeaux,'" added Margaret.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"A dollar and a quarter saved already," said
James thoughtfully. "Now let's have the message."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Tom's original suggestion&mdash;'Is
Schuler dead'?" asked Ethel Blue. "I
suppose we must leave out the 'Mr.' if we are going
to be economical."</p>

<p>"Sign it 'Morton, Secretary United Service Club,
Rosemont.' I'll file Ethel Blue's address&mdash;at the
cable office so the answer will be sent to her if one
comes."</p>

<p>Ethel Blue looked somewhat agitated at the prospect
of receiving a cable almost from the battlefield,
but she said nothing.</p>

<p>"The United Service Club was the last group of
people she saw in America, you see," Tom went on,
"so Edward thinks she'll know at once whom the
message comes from and she'll guess that the high
school scholars want to know about their former
teacher."</p>

<p>"I have a feeling in my bones that she'll get the
message and that she'll answer," said Ethel Blue.</p>

<p>"If she doesn't get it we shan't have done any
harm," mused Ethel Brown, "and if she does get it
and answers then we shall have done a lot of good
by getting the information for Fr&auml;ulein."</p>

<p>"We needn't tell anybody about it outside of our
families and then there won't be any expectations to
be disappointed."</p>

<p>"It certainly would be best not to tell Fr&auml;ulein."</p>

<p>"That's settled, then," said Tom, "and I'll send
the message the moment I reach town this afternoon."</p>

<p>"It's the most thrilling thing I ever had anything
to do with," Ethel Blue whispered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LEATHER AND BRASS</div>


<div class='cap'>THE following week was filled with expectation
of a reply from Mademoiselle, but none came
though every ring at the Mortons' doorbell was
answered with the utmost promptness by one or another
of the children who made a point of rushing
to the door before Mary could reach it.</div>

<p>"I suppose we could hardly expect to have a reply,"
sighed Ethel Blue, "but it would have been <i>so</i>
splendiferous if it did come!"</p>

<p>Thanks to Dicky's escapade the last Saturday
afternoon had been so broken in upon that the Club
decided that they must have an all-day session on
the next Saturday. Roger had promised to teach
the others how to do the leather and brass work in
which he had become quite expert, and he was talking
to himself about it as he was dressing after doing
his morning work.</p>

<p>"This business of working in leather for orphan
children makes a noise like toil to me," he soliloquized.
"But think of the joy of the kids when they
receive a leather penwiper, though they aren't yet
old enough to write, or a purse when they haven't
any shekels to put into it!"</p>

<p>"Ro&mdash;ger," came a voice from a long way off.</p>

<p>"Let's go over to Dorothy's now," Roger called
back as if it had been Ethel Brown who was late.</p>

<p>"I should say so! The Watkinses and Hancocks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
said they'd be there at ten and it must be that now.
I'll call Ethel Blue and Helen," and Ethel Brown's
voice came from a greater distance than before.</p>

<p>The other girls were not to be discovered, however,
and when Roger and Ethel arrived at Dorothy's
they found all the rest waiting for them.</p>

<p>"Where's this professor of leather?" called Tom
as he heard Roger's steps on the attic stairs.</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> brass," added Roger grandly as he appeared
in the doorway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"No one disputes the brass," returned Tom, and
Roger roared cheerfully and called out "Bull's-eye!"</p>

<p>"Now, then," began Roger seating himself at the
head of the table, "with apologies to the president
I'll call this solemn meeting to order&mdash;that is, as
much order as there can be with Dicky around."</p>

<p>Dicky was even then engaged in trying to make a
hole in Ethel Blue's shoe with a leather punch, but he
was promptly suppressed and placed between the
Ethels before his purpose was accomplished.</p>

<p>"You've got him interned there," remarked James,
using a phrase that was becoming customary in the
newspaper accounts of the care of prisoners.</p>

<p>"I'm going to start you people making corners for
a big blotting pad," said Roger, "not because the
orphans will want a blotting pad, but because they
are easy to make and you can adapt the idea to lots
of other articles."</p>

<p>"Fire ahead," commanded James.</p>

<p>"You make a paper pattern to fit your corner&mdash;so
fashion," and Roger tore a sheet of paper off a pad
and cut a slip ten inches long and four inches wide.
A point in the middle of the long side he placed on
the corner of the big blotter that lay before him and
then he folded the rest of the paper around the
corner. The result was a smooth triangle on the
face of the blotter and a triangle at the back just
like it except that it was split up the middle.</p>

<p>"Here's your pattern," said Roger slipping it off.
"When you make this of brass or copper it's a good
plan to round these back corners so there won't be
any sharp points to stick into you or to scratch the
desk."</p>

<p>"The orphans' mahogany."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Or Grandfather Emerson's. I'm going to inflict
a set on him at Christmas."</p>

<p>"I should think it would be hard to work on such
dinky little things," remarked James who had large
hands.</p>

<p>"You don't cut them out of your big sheet of copper
or your big piece of leather yet. You draw the
size of this small pattern on to a larger piece of
paper and you draw your ornamental design right
where you want it on the face of the triangle&mdash;so."</p>

<p>"More work for Ethel Blue, making original designs."</p>

<p>"She might get up some U. S. C. designs and have
them copyrighted," suggested Helen.</p>

<p>"Until she does we'll have to use these simple figures
that I traced out of a book the other day."</p>

<p>"Why couldn't we use our stenciling designs?"</p>

<p>"You could, if they are the right size. That
star pattern you put oh a doll's skirt would be just
the ticket&mdash;just one star for each corner."</p>

<p>"We might put U. S. C. in each corner."</p>

<p>"Or U. in one corner and S. in another, and C. in
a third and a star or something in the fourth."</p>

<p>"Or the initials of the person you give it to."</p>

<p>"We've got the size of the corner piece as it is
when it's unfolded and with its design on it, all drawn
on this piece of paper. Now you tack your sheet
of brass on to a block of wood and lay a sheet of
carbon paper over it and your design on that and
trace ahead."</p>

<p>"I see, I see," commented Margaret. "When you
take it off, there you have the size of your corner indicated
and the star or whatever you're going to
ornament it with, all drawn in the right place."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Exactly. Now we tackle the brass itself."</p>

<p>"It seems to me we ought to have some tools for
that."</p>

<p>"A light hammer and a wire nail&mdash;that's all. See
the point of this nail? It has been filed flat and
rather dull. I made enough for everybody to have
one&mdash;not you, sir," and he snatched away one of
them from Dicky just as that young man was about
to nail Ethel Brown's dress on to the edge of her
chair.</p>

<p>"Dicky will have to be interned at home if he
isn't quiet." The president shook her head at the
honorary member.</p>

<p>"First you go around the whole outline, tapping
the nail gently, stroke by stroke, until the line of the
design is completely hammered in."</p>

<p>"That isn't hard," said Tom. "Watch me."</p>

<p>"When the outline is made you take another wire
nail that has been filed perfectly flat on the bottom
and go over the whole background with it."</p>

<p>"I see, I see," cried Ethel Blue. "That makes
the design stand out puffily and smooth against a
sort of motheaten background."</p>

<p>"For eloquent description commend me to Ethel
Blue," declared Margaret.</p>

<p>"She's right, though. You can make the moth
holes of different size by using nails of different
sizes. There are regular tools that come, too, with
different pounding surfaces so it's possible to make
quite a variety of backgrounds."</p>

<p>"This mothy one is pretty enough for me," declared
Margaret.</p>

<p>"I don't much like that name for it, but it is pretty,
just the same," insisted Roger. "When you've hammered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
down the background you take out the tacks
and cut out your whole corner with this pair of shears
that is made to cut metal. Then you fold over the
backs just the way you folded over the paper to find
the shape originally."</p>

<p>"It's not so terribly easy to bend," commented
Ethel Blue.</p>

<p>"Shape them along the edge of your block of
wood. Persuade them down&mdash;so, and fold them
back&mdash;so. Tap them into place with your wooden
mallet. There you are."</p>

<p>The finished corner was passed from hand to hand
and duly admired.</p>

<p>"Rub it shiny with any brass polish, if you like it
bright," directed Roger.</p>

<p>"It's fashionable for coppers to be dull now," said
Helen.</p>

<p>"You ladies know more about fashions of all sorts
than I should ever pretend to," said her brother
meekly. "I like metals to shine, myself."</p>

<p>"What are some of the articles we can start
in to make now that we know how?" questioned
Margaret.</p>

<p>"All sorts of things for the desk&mdash;a paper knife
and a roller blotter and a case to hold the inkwell
and a clip to keep papers from blowing away. The
work is just the same, no matter what you're making.
It's all a matter of getting the outlines of different
objects and then bending them up carefully
after you've hammered the design and got them cut
out well."</p>

<p>"Why can't you make all sorts of boxes?" asked
James whose mind had run to boxes ever since his
week of work upon them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can. All sorts and sizes. Line them with
silk or leather. Leather wears best."</p>

<p>"How far is the leather work like the metal
work?" asked Ethel Brown. "It seemed to be the
same as far as the point where you tacked them on
to the wooden block."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;A beauty leather mat&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"It is the same except that you wet the leather
before you tack it on to the block. When you put
your design on to the leather you don't need to use
carbon paper. Borrow one of Ethel Brown's knitting
needles and run it over the design that you have
drawn on the paper placed over the leather, and it
will leave a tiny groove on the damp leather."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's a simple instrument."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;A three cornered purse that doesn&#39;t need any sewing&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"The steel tooler you take next is simple, too.
You deepen the groove with its edge and then take
the flat part of the tooler and go over every bit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the leather outside of the design, pressing it and
polishing it with great care."</p>

<p>"I suppose that gives the leather a different texture."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p219.jpg" width="400" height="418" alt="The three cornered purse completed" title="" />
<span class="caption">The three cornered purse completed</span>
</div>

<p>"It seems to. It makes the design show more,
anyway."</p>

<p>"I saw a beauty leather mat the other day with a
cotton boll design that puffed right up from the
background.</p>

<p>"The cotton boll caught our little Dorothy's eye,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of course! You make your design puff out by rubbing
it on the back with a round headed tool. Your
mat probably had the puffed up part filled with wax
so it wouldn't smash down again when something
heavy was placed on it."</p>

<p>"I think it did; it felt hard."</p>

<p>"If you do puff out any part of your pattern you
have to tool over the design again, because the outline
will have lost its sharpness."</p>

<p>"The mat I saw was colored."</p>

<p>"That's easy. There are colors that come especially
for using on leather. You float them on when
the leather is wet and you can get beautiful effects."</p>

<p>"You ought not to cut out your leather corners
until they are dry, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"They ought to be thoroughly dry. If you want
a lining for a purse or a cardcase you can paste in
either silk or a thin leather. It's pretty to make
an openwork design and let the lining show through."</p>

<p>"How about sewing purses? It must be hard
work."</p>

<p>"Helen does mine on the machine. She says it
isn't much trouble if she goes slowly and takes a few
stitches back at the ends so they won't come apart.
But I'm going to show you how to make a little
three cornered purse that doesn't need any sewing&mdash;only
two glove snappers."</p>

<p>So simple was this pattern that each of them had
finished one by the time that Grandmother Emerson's
car came to take them all over to luncheon at
her house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE ETHELS COOK TO KEEP</div>


<div class='cap'>ANOTHER week rolled on and still no reply
came to the cable that the Club had sent to
Mademoiselle Millerand.</div>

<p>"Either she hasn't received it," said Ethel Blue,
who felt a personal interest because it had been
signed by her as Secretary of the club, "or Mr.
Schuler is dead and she doesn't want to tell us."</p>

<p>"It's pretty sure to be one or the other," said
Ethel Brown. "I suppose we might as well forget
that we tried to do anything about it."</p>

<p>"Have you heard Roger or Helen say anything
about Fr&auml;ulein lately?"</p>

<p>"Helen said she looked awfully sad and that she
was wearing black. Evidently she has no hope."</p>

<p>"Poor Fr&auml;ulein!"</p>

</div>

<p>"What are we going to do this week?"</p>

<p>"I've planned the cunningest little travelling bag
for a doll. It's a straight strip of leather, tooled in
a pretty pattern. It's doubled in halves and there
is a three-cornered piece let in at the ends to give a
bit more room."</p>

<p>"How do you fasten it?"</p>

<p>"Like a Boston bag, with a strap that goes over
the top."</p>

<p>"You could run a cord in and out parallel with the
top and pull it up."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe I'll make two and try both ways."</p>

<p>"You could make the same pattern only a little
larger for a wrist bag for an
older child."</p>


<p>"And larger still for a shopping
bag for a grown person."</p>

<p>"That's as useful a pattern
as Helen's and Margaret's
wrapper pattern! Do you realize
that this is the week that
we ought to cook?"</p>

<p>"Is it? We'll have to hurry
fearfully! Are you perfectly
sure the things will keep?"</p>

<p>"I've talked it over several
times with Miss Dawson, the
domestic science teacher. She
has given me some splendid receipts
and some information
about packing. She says there won't be any doubt
of their travelling all right."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll have to cook every afternoon, then.
We'd better go over the receipts and see if we have
all the materials we need."</p>

<p>"We know about the cookies and the fruit cake
and the fudge. We've made all those such a short
time ago that we know we have those materials.
Here are ginger snaps," she went on, examining her
cook book. "We haven't enough molasses I'm sure,
and I'm doubtful about the ginger."</p>

<p>"Let me see."</p>

<p>Ethel Blue read over the receipt.</p>

<p>"Sift flour, soda, and spices together. Melt the
butter, put the molasses in a big bowl, add the butter,
then the flour gradually, using a knife to cut it in.
When stiff enough to roll, roll out portions quite
thin on a floured board, cut out with a cookie cutter
or with the cover of a baking powder can. Place
them on greased tins, leaving a little space between
each cookie. Bake in a hot oven about five minutes."</p>

<p>"Miss Dawson says we must let the cookies get
perfectly cold before we pack them. Then we must
wrap them in paraffin paper and pack them tightly
into a box."</p>

<p>"They ought to be so tight that they won't rattle
round and break."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"If we could get enough tin boxes it would be
great."</p>

<p>"Let's ask Grandmother Emerson and Aunt
Louise and all Mother's friends to save their biscuit
boxes for us."</p>

<p>"We ought to have thought of asking them before.
And we must go out foraging for baking powder tins
to steam the little fruit puddings and the small loaves
of Boston brown bread in."</p>

<p>"What a jolly idea!"</p>

<p>"Miss Dawson says that when they are cold we
can slip them out of their tins and brush the bread
and pudding and cake over with pure alcohol. That
will kill the mould germs and it will all be evaporated
by the time they are opened."</p>

<p>"If there is paraffin paper around them, too, and
they are slipped back into their little round tins it
seems to me they ought to be as cosy and good as possible."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully taken with the individual puddings.
We can make them all different sizes according
to the size of the tins we get hold of. Doesn't this
sound good?"</p>

smile.</p>

<p>The time given by the Ethels to preparing for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
their cooking operations was well spent. Never
once did they have to call on Mary for something
they had forgotten to order, and each afternoon was
pronounced a success when it was over and its results
lay before them.</p>

<p>"If we just had energy enough we might follow
the plan that the candy store people do when they
have a new clerk. They say that they let her eat all
she wants to for the first few days and then she
doesn't want any more. It would be fun to give the
family all they wanted."</p>

<p>"We really ought to do it before we set the Club
to work packing all these goodies, but I don't see
how we can with those three boys. We never could
fill them up so they'd stop eating."</p>

<p>"Nev-<i>er!</i>"</p>

<p>"Not Roger!"</p>

<p>"We'll just have to give them a lecture on self-control
and set them to work."</p>

<p>"It's a glorious lot we've got. Where's Mother?
We must show them to her and Grandmother and
Aunt Louise."</p>

<p>So there was an exhibit of "food products" that
brought the Ethels many compliments. Shelf upon
shelf of their private kitchen was filled with boxes
and tins, and every day added to the quantity, for
Mary came in occasionally to bring a wee fruit cake,
Aunt Louise sent over cookies, and Mrs. Emerson
added a box of professional candy to the pile.</p>

<p>"They tell me at the candy store that very
hard candy doesn't last well," she said. "It grows
moist."</p>

<p>"That's why Miss Dawson gave me these receipts
for softish candies like fudge. It's well to remember<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
that at Christmas time when you're selecting candies
for presents."</p>

<p>"I don't believe the Ethels ever will buy any
candies again," said Mrs. Morton. "They've become
so expert in making them that they quite look
down on the professionals."</p>

<p>"Did you see the paper this morning?" asked
Mrs. Emerson.</p>

<p>When the girls said that they had not, she produced
a clipping.</p>

<p>"Grandfather thought that perhaps this might
have escaped your notice, so he sent it over."</p>

<p>Ethel Brown took it and Ethel Blue read it over
her shoulder.</p>

<div class='center'>CARGO FOR CHRISTMAS SHIP GATHERING
HERE FROM EVERY STATE</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Hundreds of cases containing every conceivable kind of
gift for a child have been received at the Bush Terminal in
Brooklyn, where the Christmas Ship <i>Jason</i>, which will
carry the gifts of American children to the orphans of the
European War is being loaded.</p>

<p>It became apparent that if the <i>Jason</i> were to get off
within reasonable time, a tremendous force of sorters and
packers would have to be employed. When the situation
was presented over the telephone to Secretary of the Navy
Daniels he secured authorization for Gen. Wood to assign
sixty soldiers to help to get the cargo ready. These men
appeared for duty yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>Secretary Daniels has assigned Lieut.-Commander Courtney
to command the Christmas Ship.</p></div>

<p>"What a fine Santa Claus-y feeling Commander
Courtney must have," said Mrs. Morton. "He's a
friend of your father's, Ethel Brown."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Think of being Santa Claus to all Europe!"</p>

<p>"Our parcels won't be very visible among several
millions, will they?"</p>

<p>"You have a wonderfully creditable collection for
ten youngsters working so short a time."</p>

<p>"Mr. Watkins is keeping in touch with the ship
so that we can make use of every day that she's delayed.
Tom telephoned to Roger this afternoon
that he had been over to the Bush Terminal and
they were sure they wouldn't start before the 10th
of November.</p>

<p>"That gives us almost a week more, you see."</p>

<p>"Do you think we could go to New York to see
the <i>Jason</i> sail?" asked Ethel Blue and both girls
waited eagerly for the reply.</p>

<p>"Aunt Louise and I were saying that the Club
ought to go in a body."</p>

<p>"If only she doesn't sail during school hours."</p>

<p>"Even then I think we might manage it for once,"
smiled Mrs. Morton, and the Ethels rushed off to
tell Roger and Helen the plan and to telephone it to
Margaret and James.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CHRISTMAS SHIP SAILS</div>


<div class='cap'>THE Rosemont and Glen Point members of the
U. S. C. did not wait for the Watkinses to join
them on Saturday before beginning to do up the
parcels for the Santa Claus Ship. All the small
bundles were wrapped and tied in Dorothy's attic,
but after Mrs. Smith had made a careful examination
of the attic stairs she came to the conclusion
that the large packing cases into which they must be
put for transportation to the Bush Terminal in
Brooklyn could not be taken down without damage
to the walls. It was therefore decided that when
the bundles were ready they were to be brought
downstairs and there packed into several large cases
which had been donated for the purpose by the local
dry goods dealer and the shoe store man.</div>

<p>Each of these huge boxes James declared to be
probably as large as the mysterious house which
Roger was going to propose for some sort of club
work in the spring. They had been delivered early
in the week and were established on the porch at the
back of the Smith cottage awaiting the contents that
were to bring pleasure to hundreds of expectant children.</p>

<p>Doctor Hancock was so busy that he could not
bring Margaret's and James's collection to Rosemont
when it was wanted there, so Mrs. Emerson
went to Glen Point in her car and brought it back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
filled high with the result of James's pasting. It
was necessary to have all his boxes to pack the candies
and cookies and small gifts in.</p>

<p>Every afternoon a busy throng gathered in the
attic, wrapping and tying and labelling the work that
kept them all so busy for the previous two months.</p>

<p>"We must do up every package just as carefully
as if we were going to put it on our own Christmas
tree," Helen decided. "I think half the fun of
Christmas is untying the bundles and having the
room all heaped up with tissue paper and bright
ribbons."</p>

<p>The Club had laid in a goodly store of tissue paper
of a great variety of colors, buying it at wholesale
and thus obtaining a discount over the retail price.
The question of what to tie with was a subject of
discussion.</p>

<p>"We certainly can't afford ribbon," Ethel Brown
declared. "Even the narrowest kind is too expensive
when we have to have hundreds of yards of it."</p>

<p>"We ought to have thought about it before," said
Helen looking rather worried, as this necessity
should have been foreseen by the president. "I'll
go right over to town and get something now," she
added, putting on her hat. "Have any of you girls
any ideas on the subject?"</p>

<p>"I have," replied Dorothy. "You know that
bright colored binding that dressmakers use on
seams? It's sometimes silk and sometimes silk
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cotton? Ha!"</p>

<p>"Silk and cotton; yes, ma'am. It comes in all
colors and it's just the right width and it costs a
good deal less than real ribbon."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose we can get the rolls by wholesale in
assorted colors, can't we?"</p>

<p>"I should suppose so."</p>

<p>"I have an idea, too," offered Margaret who had
come over on the trolley after school was over.
"There's a tinsel cord, silver and gilt, that doesn't
cost much and it looks bright and pretty. It would
be just the thing."</p>

<p>"I've seen that. It does look pretty. For home
packages you can stick a sprig of holly or a poinsettia
in the knot and it makes it C-H-A-R-M-I-N-G,"
spelled Ethel Blue, giving herself a whirl in her excitement.</p>

<p>"But we can't use stick-ups on our Christmas Ship
parcels, you know."</p>

<p>"That's so, but the tinsel string just by itself is
quite pretty enough."</p>

<p>"I'll bring back bushels," said Helen. "You have
enough to go on with for a while."</p>

<p>"One year when Mother and I were caught at the
last minute on Christmas Eve without any ribbon,"
said Dorothy, "&mdash;it was after the shops had closed,
I remember, we found several bundles that we had
overlooked&mdash;we tied them with ordinary red and
green string twisted together. It looked holly-fied."</p>

<p>"That would be easy to do," said Roger. "See,
put two balls of twine, one red and one green in a
box and punch a hole in the top and let the two
colors come out of the hole. Then use them just as
if they were one cord. See?"</p>

<p>"As he talked he manufactured a twine box, popping
into it not only the red and green balls about
which he had been talking, but, on the other side of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
a slip of pasteboard which he put in for a partition,
a ball of pink and a ball of blue.</p>

<p>"Watch Roger developing another color scheme,"
cried Ethel Blue. "I'm going to follow that out,"
and she proceeded to make up a collection of parcels
wrapped in pink tissue paper tied with blue string,
in blue paper tied with pink cord and in white tied
with Roger's combination.</p>

<p>"There's one family fitted out with a lot of presents
all naturally belonging together," she cried.</p>

<p>"I rather like that notion myself," announced
James gravely, adjusting his lame leg to a more comfortable
position. "Please hand me that brown and
yellow tissue, somebody. I'm going to make a lot of
bundles along the color lines that my auburn haired
sister uses in her dress."</p>

<p>"Observant little Jimmy," commented Margaret.</p>

<p>"Here you perceive, ladies, that I am doing up the
bundles with brown and yellow and burnt orange and
tango, and lemon color, and I'm tying them with a
contrast&mdash;brown with orange and buttercup yellow
with brown and lemon yellow with white and so on.
Good looking, eh?" he finished, pointing with pride
to his group of attractive parcels.</p>

<p>"I'm going to do a bunch with a mixture of all
sorts," announced Roger. "Here's a green tied with
red and a white tied with green and a pink tied with
white and a brown tied with tango, and violet tied
with blue, <i>und so weiter</i>, as our Fr&auml;ulein says when
she means 'and so forth' and can't remember her
English fast enough."</p>

<p>"Poor Fr&auml;ulein! It will be a hard Christmas for
her."</p>

<p>"She brought in the last of her work and Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Hindenburg's yesterday. Such a mound of knitting!"</p>

<p>"Has any one been to the Old Ladies' Home to
gather up what they have there?" asked James.</p>

<p>"Roger went early this morning before school.
Perhaps those old ladies haven't been busy! See
that pile?"</p>

<p>"All theirs? Good work," and James set about
tying up the soft and comfortable knitted mufflers
and wristlets and socks, first in tissue paper with a
ribbon or a bright cord and then with a stouter wrapper
of ordinary paper. He marked on each package
what was in it.</p>

<p>"If the people who are doing the sorting and repacking
at the Bush Terminal can know what is in
each bundle it is going to help them a lot," remarked
methodical James.</p>

<p>The packing of the candies and cookies took especial
care, for they had to be wrapped in paraffin
paper and tightly wedged in the fancy boxes awaiting
them before they could be wrapped with their
gay outside coverings.</p>

<p>"We want them to arrive with some shape still
left to them and not merely a boxful of crumbs,"
said Ethel Brown earnestly.</p>

<p>Except for the collections of varied presents which
they had made for the sake of the color schemes of
their wrappings&mdash;an arrangement with which Helen
was much pleased when she came back laden with
ribbons and cord&mdash;the gifts were packed according
to their kind. Every article of clothing was
wrapped separately and the bundles were labelled,
each with the name of the article within, and then
put into one large box. It was only by great squeezing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
that the knitted articles were persuaded to go
into the same case.</p>

<p>In another box were the candies and cookies and
cakes and breads. The grocer from whom they had
bought the materials for their cooking had contributed
a dozen tins of peaches.</p>

<p>In still another case went the seemingly innumerable
small parcels that held toys or little gifts.
Here were the metal pieces and the leather coin
purses and the stuffed animals and the dolls. Doctor
Hancock had sent over a box of raisins and Mrs.
Watkins had sent out from town a box of figs and a
few of these goodies with two or three pieces of
candy, went into every article that could be made to
serve as a container. Of this sort were the innumerable
fancy bags made of silk bits and of cretonne and
of scraps of velvet which the girls had put together
when other work flagged. Many of the pretty little
baskets held a pleasant amount of sweeties, and the
tiny leather travelling bags and the larger wrist bags
of tooled leather were lined with a piece of paraffin
paper enclosing something for sweet-toothed European
children.</p>

<p>James's boxes, with those made by the others, held
out wonderfully.</p>

<p>"You certainly put in a good week's work with the
paste pot," declared Roger admiringly as he filled
the last one with sugar cookies and tied it with green
and red twine to harmonize with its covering of holly
paper.</p>

<p>The Watkinses had sent out their offerings, for
they wanted what they had at home to be packed
with the other Club articles, even though they lived
nearer than the rest to the place from which the ship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
was going to steam. When this additional collection
was prepared and packed it was found that there
were three big packing cases.</p>

<p>"Good for the U. S. C.!" cried the boys as the
last nail went into the last cover.</p>

<p>James, who printed well, painted the address
neatly on the tops and sides, and they all watched
with vivid interest the drayman who hauled them,
away, generously contributing his services to the
Christmas cause.</p>

<p>After all their hurry it seemed something of a
hardship when they were informed that the sailing
of the ship was delayed for several days because the
force of packers, large as it was, could not prepare
all the parcels in time for the tenth of the month.</p>

<p>"The paper says there are more than sixty car-loads
of gifts," read Ethel Blue to her interested
family, "and five or six million separate presents."</p>

<p>"No wonder they're delayed!"</p>

<p>Yet after all they were glad of the delay for the
<i>Jason</i> finally sailed at noon of the fourteenth, and
that was Saturday. The Hancocks went in to New
York and over to Brooklyn in the Doctor's car and
Mrs. Emerson's big touring car held all the Mortons
and Dorothy and her mother, and Fr&auml;ulein and her
mother, though it was a tight squeeze.</p>

<p>"The old woman who lived in a shoe must have
been on her way to a Christmas Ship," cried Grandmother
when Roger tossed Dicky in "on top of the
heap of Ethels," as he described it and took up his
own station on the running board.</p>

<p>The pier at the Bush Terminal in Brooklyn was
already well crowded with people and motors when
the Rosemont party arrived. The Watkinses and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the Hancocks were already there. Freight cars
stood at one side, freight cars empty now of their
loads of good cheer. Everybody was laughing and
happy and in a Christmas mood, and the boy band
from St. John's Home in Brooklyn made merry
music.</p>

<p>Thanks to Mrs. Morton's acquaintance with Lieutenant-Commander
Courtney, who was in command
of the ship, she and her flock had been invited to
hear the speeches of farewell made in the main
saloon by representatives of the city of New York.</p>

<p>Roger led the way to the gang plank which
stretched from the pier to the deck of the huge navy
collier.</p>

<p>"Old <i>Jason</i> looks grim enough in his gray war
paint," he commented.</p>

<p>"But those great latticed arms of the six cranes
look as if he were trying to play Christmas tree,"
suggested Mrs. Emerson.</p>

<p>The speeches were full of good will and Christmas
cheer. Back on to the pier went the listeners
and then amid the cheers of the throng on the dock
and the whistles of near-by boats and the strains
of "The Star Spangled Banner" from the boys' band
and the waving of handkerchiefs and hats, the huge
gray steamer slipped out into the stream and started
on her way across the ocean.</p>

<p>It was when the U. S. C. was making its way back
to the automobiles that a piercing scream attracted
their attention.</p>

<p>"That sounds like Fr&auml;ulein's voice," said Helen,
looking about for the source of the cry.</p>

<p>"<i>Meine Tochter!</i>" exclaimed Mrs. Hindenburg at
the same moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>And then they came upon Fr&auml;ulein, her arms about
the neck of a bearded man, who stroked her hair and
cheek with one hand while with the other he clung to
one of the crutches which gave him but an insecure
support.</p>

<p>"<i>Lieber Heinrich!</i>" cried Mrs. Hindenburg as she
caught sight of the tableau.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;yes, I believe it's Mr. Schuler! Look,
Helen, do you think it is?" whispered Roger.</p>

<p>"It must be," returned Helen. "It's hard to tell
with that beard, but I'm almost sure it is."</p>

<p>"His leg! Oh, Helen, his leg is gone!" lamented
Ethel Blue.</p>

<p>The Rosemont party's certainty was relieved by
Mrs. Hindenburg who turned to them, beaming.</p>

<p>"It iss Mr. Schuler; it iss Heinrich," she explained.
"<i>He</i> has lost his leg. What matter?
He is here and the <i>Tochter</i> is happy!"</p>

<p>Happy indeed was Fr&auml;ulein when she turned her
tear-stained face toward the others.</p>

<p>"He has come," she said simply, while the rest
crowded around and shook hands.</p>

<p>It seemed that he had obtained leave to return to
America because he had lost his leg and could fight
no more. Yes, he said, Mademoiselle Millerand
had nursed him when his leg was taken off.</p>

<p>The spectators of the moving pictures looked at
each other and nodded.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle had sent a message to the Secretary
of the United Service Club, he went on. It was&mdash;he
took a slip of paper from his pocket book.</p>

<p>"Message received. Answered in person."</p>

<p>The Club members laughed at this whose whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
meaning it was clear that Mr. Schuler did not appreciate.</p>

<p>He had arrived, it seemed, only two hours before,
on an Italian boat, and had heard on the way up
from Quarantine of the sailing of the Christmas
Ship and so had crossed to wave a farewell before
going out to Rosemont.</p>

<p>"And here I have found my best fortune," he said
over and over again, his eyes resting fondly on
Fr&auml;ulein's face.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A WEDDING AND A SURPRISE</div>


<div class='cap'>IT was a simple wedding that the U. S. C. went to
in a body a few days after the arrival of the convalescent
German soldier. Mr. Wheeler, the principal
of the high school, acted as best man, and Miss
Dawson, the domestic science teacher, was maid of
honor, but Fr&auml;ulein also gathered about her in the
cottage sitting-room where the ceremony took place
a group of the young girls who had been kindest to
her when she was in trouble.</div>

<p>"I want you and the Ethels and Dorothy," she said
to Helen; "and if your friends, Della and Margaret,
would come with you it would give me greatest pleasure."</p>

<p>So the girls, all dressed in white, and wearing the
forget-me-not pins that Grandfather Emerson insisted
on giving them for the occasion, clustered
around the young teacher, and the three boys, a
forget-me-not in each scarfpin, held the ribbons that
pressed gently back the cordial friends who were
happy in Fr&auml;ulein's happiness.</p>

<p>It was the Club that decorated the house with
brown sedges and stalks of upstanding tawny corn
and vines of bittersweet. And it was the Club that
sang a soft German marriage song as the bride and
groom drove off toward the setting sun in Grandmother
Emerson's car.</p>

<p>Life seemed rather flat to the members of the U.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
S. C. after the wedding. For the last two months
they had been so busy that every hour had been filled
with work and play-work, and now that there was
nothing especial scheduled for every waking moment
it seemed as if they had nothing at all to do.</p>

<p>"We'll have to ask Roger about his house,"
laughed James who came over with Margaret one
afternoon and confessed to the same feeling.</p>

<p>"Not yet," answered Helen.</p>

<p>"Helen is full of ideas up to her very eyebrows, I
believe," said Ethel Blue. "She's just giving us a
holiday."</p>

<p>"Mother said we needed one," assented Helen.
"After we've had a few days' rest we can start on
something else. There's no need to call on Roger
yet awhile."</p>

<p>"Why not? My idea is a perfectly good one," insisted
Roger, strolling in.</p>

<p>Just at this minute Mary entered with a note for
"The Secretary of the United Service Club."</p>

<p>"For you, Ethel Blue," said Roger, handing it to
his cousin.</p>

<p>Ethel Blue slipped a cutter under the edge while
the others waited expectantly, for the address indicated
that the contents was of interest to all of
them.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" she cried as she read.
"What is it? Is it true?"</p>

<p>She was so excited that they all crowded around
her to see what had taken away her power of explanation.</p>

<p>The letter was signed "Justine Millerand."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," cried all who could see the signature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"She says," read Ethel Blue, finding her strength
again, "'Here is the Belgian baby you asked for.
She is two years old and her name is "Elisabeth,"
after the Queen of Belgium!'"</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"But she says, '<i>Here</i> is the Belgian baby.'
<i>Where</i> is the Belgian baby?"</p>

<p>They turned toward Mary who had remained in
the room.</p>

<p>"There's a Red Cross nurse in the reception
room," she explained. "She said she'd rather you
read the letter first."</p>

<p>They made a rush for the door. Roger reached
it first and ushered the nurse into the living room.
She was dressed in her grey uniform and sheltered
under her cape the thinnest, wannest mite of humanity
that ever the Club had seen outside of the
streets of a city slum.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Millerand said you had asked for
a Belgian baby," she began, but she was interrupted
by a cry from the entire throng.</p>

<p>"We did; we did," they exclaimed so earnestly
that any doubts she may have felt about the cordiality
of their reception of her nursling were banished at
once.</p>

<p>"Your mother?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't believe Mother really expected it to come,
any more than we did," replied Helen frankly, "but
she will love it just as we will, and we'll take the very
best of care of her."</p>

<p>She offered her finger to Elisabeth, who clutched it
and gazed solemnly at her out of her sunken blue
eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Ethel Blue in the back of the group gave a sob.</p>

<p>"She'll pick up soon when she has good food every
day," the nurse reassured them, and then she told
them of her own experiences.</p>

<p>She had been, it seemed, in the same hospital with
Mademoiselle in Belgium. Out on the field one day
a bit of shrapnel had wounded her foot so that she
was forced to come home. Mademoiselle had asked
her to bring over this mite "to the kindest young people
in the world," and here she was.</p>

<p>The baby's father and mother were both dead, she
went on. That she knew.</p>

<p>"Are you sure her name is Elisabeth?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"That's what she calls herself."</p>

<p>By this time Elisabeth had made friends with
every one of them and was sitting comfortably on
one of Roger's knees while Dicky occupied the other
and made acceptable gestures toward her.</p>

<p>"She'll be happy here," said the nurse, and rose to
explain her visit to Mrs. Morton.</p>

<p>Like the girls, Mrs. Morton had not expected that
Mademoiselle would respond to their request for a
Belgian baby and she was somewhat taken back by
its appearance.</p>

<p>"I can see that you did not look for her," the nurse
suggested, "but when you are on the spot and are
seeing such hideous distress every day and a chance
opens to relieve just one little child, it is more than
you can resist. I know that is why Mademoiselle
Millerand sent her."</p>

<p>"I quite understand," responded Mrs. Morton
cordially. "Elisabeth shall have a happy home in
Rosemont."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"And a baker's dozen of fathers and mothers to
make up for her own," said James.</p>

<p>"And we're grateful to you for bringing her,"
said Ethel Blue, offering her hand.</p>

<p>It was after the nurse had had a cup of tea and
had returned to New York that Helen called the
Club to order formally.</p>

<p>"The Club has got its work cut out for it for a
long time to come," she said. "I don't think we
have any right to bring this baby over to America
and then send it to an orphanage, though that would
be the easiest way to do."</p>

<p>"We'll never do that," said Margaret firmly.</p>

<p>"If we are going to take care of it it means that
we'll have to earn money for it and give it our personal
care. Now, all in favor of accepting Elisabeth
as our Club baby, say 'Aye.'"</p>

<p>There was a hearty assent.</p>

<p>"There are no contrary-minded," declared the
president. "From now on she belongs to us."</p>

<p>"And here's my forget-me-not pin to prove it,"
said Ethel Blue, fastening it on the baby's dress.</p>

<p>"Just what we'll have to do about her we must
think out carefully and talk over with our mothers,"
went on Helen. "But this minute we can accept our
new club member and cry all together, 'Three cheers
for Elisabeth of Belgium.'"</p>

<p>And at the shout that followed, Elisabeth of Belgium
gave her first faint smile.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
